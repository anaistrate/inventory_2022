28917032,CFS MATLAB toolbox: An experiment builder for continuous flash suppression (CFS) task.,"CFS toolbox is an open-source collection of MATLAB functions that utilizes PsychToolbox-3 (PTB-3). It is designed to allow a researcher to create and run continuous flash suppression experiments using a variety of experimental parameters (i.e., stimulus types and locations, noise characteristics, and experiment window settings). In a CFS experiment, one of the eyes at a time is presented with a dynamically changing noise pattern, while the other eye is concurrently presented with a static target stimulus, such as a Gabor patch. Due to the strong interocular suppression created by the dominant noise pattern mask, the target stimulus is rendered invisible for an extended duration. Very little knowledge of MATLAB is required for using the toolbox; experiments are generated by modifying csv files with the required parameters, and result data are output to text files for further analysis. The open-source code is available on the project page under a Creative Commons License ( http://www.mikkonuutinen.arkku.net/CFS_toolbox/ and https://bitbucket.org/mikkonuutinen/cfs_toolbox ).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
29036410,SPRINT: an SNP-free toolkit for identifying RNA editing sites.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>RNA editing generates post-transcriptional sequence alterations. Detection of RNA editing sites (RESs) typically requires the filtering of SNVs called from RNA-seq data using an SNP database, an obstacle that is difficult to overcome for most organisms.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a novel method named SPRINT that identifies RESs without the need to filter out SNPs. SPRINT also integrates the detection of hyper RESs from remapped reads, and has been fully automated to any RNA-seq data with reference genome sequence available. We have rigorously validated SPRINT's effectiveness in detecting RESs using RNA-seq data of samples in which genes encoding RNA editing enzymes are knock down or over-expressed, and have also demonstrated its superiority over current methods. We have applied SPRINT to investigate RNA editing across tissues and species, and also in the development of mouse embryonic central nervous system. A web resource (http://sprint.tianlab.cn) of RESs identified by SPRINT has been constructed.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software and related data are available at http://sprint.tianlab.cn.<h4>Contact</h4>weidong.tian@fudan.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

29539190,"MSeqDR mvTool: A mitochondrial DNA Web and API resource for comprehensive variant annotation, universal nomenclature collation, and reference genome conversion.","Accurate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variant annotation is essential for the clinical diagnosis of diverse human diseases. Substantial challenges to this process include the inconsistency in mtDNA nomenclatures, the existence of multiple reference genomes, and a lack of reference population frequency data. Clinicians need a simple bioinformatics tool that is user-friendly, and bioinformaticians need a powerful informatics resource for programmatic usage. Here, we report the development and functionality of the MSeqDR mtDNA Variant Tool set (mvTool), a one-stop mtDNA variant annotation and analysis Web service. mvTool is built upon the MSeqDR infrastructure (https://mseqdr.org), with contributions of expert curated data from MITOMAP (https://www.mitomap.org) and HmtDB (https://www.hmtdb.uniba.it/hmdb). mvTool supports all mtDNA nomenclatures, converts variants to standard rCRS- and HGVS-based nomenclatures, and annotates novel mtDNA variants. Besides generic annotations from dbNSFP and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), mvTool provides allele frequencies in more than 47,000 germline mitogenomes, and disease and pathogenicity classifications from MSeqDR, Mitomap, HmtDB and ClinVar (Landrum et al., 2013). mvTools also provides mtDNA somatic variants annotations. ""mvTool API"" is implemented for programmatic access using inputs in VCF, HGVS, or classical mtDNA variant nomenclatures.

29718389,An update on PUG-REST: RESTful interface for programmatic access to PubChem.,"PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) is one of the largest open chemical information resources available. It currently receives millions of unique users per month on average, serving as a key resource for many research fields such as cheminformatics, chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, and drug discovery. PubChem provides multiple programmatic access routes to its data and services. One of them is PUG-REST, a Representational State Transfer (REST)-like web service interface to PubChem. On average, PUG-REST receives more than a million requests per day from tens of thousands of unique users. The present paper provides an update on PUG-REST since our previous paper published in 2015. This includes access to new kinds of data (e.g. concise bioactivity data, table of contents headings, etc.), full implementation of synchronous fast structure search, support for assay data retrieval using accession identifiers in response to the deprecation of NCBI's GI numbers, data exchange between PUG-REST and NCBI's E-Utilities through the List Gateway, implementation of dynamic traffic control through throttling, and enhanced usage policies.

29718411,BUSCA: an integrative web server to predict subcellular localization of proteins.,"Here, we present BUSCA (http://busca.biocomp.unibo.it), a novel web server that integrates different computational tools for predicting protein subcellular localization. BUSCA combines methods for identifying signal and transit peptides (DeepSig and TPpred3), GPI-anchors (PredGPI) and transmembrane domains (ENSEMBLE3.0 and BetAware) with tools for discriminating subcellular localization of both globular and membrane proteins (BaCelLo, MemLoci and SChloro). Outcomes from the different tools are processed and integrated for annotating subcellular localization of both eukaryotic and bacterial protein sequences. We benchmark BUSCA against protein targets derived from recent CAFA experiments and other specific data sets, reporting performance at the state-of-the-art. BUSCA scores better than all other evaluated methods on 2732 targets from CAFA2, with a F1 value equal to 0.49 and among the best methods when predicting targets from CAFA3. We propose BUSCA as an integrated and accurate resource for the annotation of protein subcellular localization.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,0,
29721311,Gene Unprediction with Spurio: A tool to identify spurious protein sequences.,"We now have access to the sequences of tens of millions of proteins. These protein sequences are essential for modern molecular biology and computational biology. The vast majority of protein sequences are derived from gene prediction tools and have no experimental supporting evidence for their translation.  Despite the increasing accuracy of gene prediction tools there likely exists a large number of spurious protein predictions in the sequence databases.  We have developed the Spurio tool to help identify spurious protein predictions in prokaryotes.  Spurio searches the query protein sequence against a prokaryotic nucleotide database using tblastn and identifies homologous sequences. The tblastn matches are used to score the query sequence's likelihood of being a spurious protein prediction using a Gaussian process model. The most informative feature is the appearance of stop codons within the presumed translation of homologous DNA sequences. Benchmarking shows that the Spurio tool is able to distinguish spurious from true proteins. However, transposon proteins are prone to be predicted as spurious because of the frequency of degraded homologs found in the DNA sequence databases. Our initial experiments suggest that less than 1% of the proteins in the UniProtKB sequence database are likely to be spurious and that Spurio is able to identify over 60 times more spurious proteins than the AntiFam resource.

30222561,Large-Scale Study of Perceptual Video Quality.,"The great variations of videographic skills in videography, camera designs, compression and processing protocols, communication and bandwidth environments, and displays leads to an enormous variety of video impairments. Current noreference (NR) video quality models are unable to handle this diversity of distortions. This is true in part because available video quality assessment databases contain very limited content, fixed resolutions, were captured using a small number of camera devices by a few videographers and have been subjected to a modest number of distortions. As such, these databases fail to adequately represent real world videos, which contain very different kinds of content obtained under highly diverse imaging conditions and are subject to authentic, complex and often commingled distortions that are difficult or impossible to simulate. As a result, NR video quality predictors tested on real-world video data often perform poorly. Towards advancing NR video quality prediction, we have constructed a largescale video quality assessment database containing 585 videos of unique content, captured by a large number of users, with wide ranges of levels of complex, authentic distortions. We collected a large number of subjective video quality scores via crowdsourcing. A total of 4776 unique participants took part in the study, yielding more than 205000 opinion scores, resulting in an average of 240 recorded human opinions per video. We demonstrate the value of the new resource, which we call the LIVE Video Quality Challenge Database (LIVE-VQC for short), by conducting a comparison of leading NR video quality predictors on it. This study is the largest video quality assessment study ever conducted along several key dimensions: number of unique contents, capture devices, distortion types and combinations of distortions, study participants, and recorded subjective scores.

30261835,Sequence homology in eukaryotes (SHOE): interactive visual tool for promoter analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Microarray and DNA-sequencing based technologies continue to produce enormous amounts of data on gene expression. This data has great potential to illuminate our understanding of biology and medicine, but the data alone is of limited value without computational tools to allow human investigators to visualize and interpret it in the context of their problem of interest.<h4>Results</h4>We created a web server called SHOE that provides an interactive, visual presentation of the available evidence of transcriptional regulation and gene co-expression to facilitate its exploration and interpretation. SHOE predicts the likely transcription factor binding sites in orthologous promoters of humans, mice, and rats using the combined information of 1) transcription factor binding preferences (position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) libraries such as Transfac32, Jaspar, HOCOMOCO, ChIP-seq, SELEX, PBM, and iPS-reprogramming factor), 2) evolutionary conservation of putative binding sites in orthologous promoters, and 3) co-expression tendencies of gene pairs based on 1,714 normal human cells selected from the Gene Expression Omnibus Database.<h4>Conclusion</h4>SHOE enables users to explore potential interactions between transcription factors and target genes via multiple data views, discover transcription factor binding motifs on top of gene co-expression, and visualize genes as a network of gene and transcription factors on its native gadget GeneViz, the CellDesigner pathway analyzer, and the Reactome database to search the pathways involved. As we demonstrate here when using the CREB1 and Nf-Œ∫B datasets, SHOE can reliably identify experimentally verified interactions and predict plausible novel ones, yielding new biological insights into the gene regulatory mechanisms involved. SHOE comes with a manual describing how to run it on a local PC or via the Garuda platform ( www.garuda-alliance.org ), where it joins other popular gadgets such as the CellDesigner pathway analyzer and the Reactome database, as part of analysis workflows to meet the growing needs of molecular biologists and medical researchers.

Several mutation damage prediction scores are available to prioritize variants, but there is currently no application to help investigators to determine the relevance of the candidate genes and variants quickly and visually from population genetics data and deleteriousness scores. Here, we present PopViz, a user-friendly, rapid, interactive, mobile-compatible webserver providing a gene-centric visualization of the variants of any human gene, with (i) population-specific minor allele frequencies from the gnomAD population genetic database; (ii) mutation damage prediction scores from CADD, EIGEN and LINSIGHT and (iii) amino-acid positions and protein domains. This application will be particularly useful in investigations of NGS data for new disease-causing genes and variants, by reinforcing or rejecting the plausibility of the candidate genes, and by selecting and prioritizing, the candidate variants for experimental testing.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PopViz webserver is freely accessible from http://shiva.rockefeller.edu/PopViz/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
30916462,MolTarPred: A web tool for comprehensive target prediction with reliability estimation.,"Molecular target prediction can provide a starting point to understand the efficacy and side effects of phenotypic screening hits. Unfortunately, the vast majority of in silico target prediction methods are not available as web tools. Furthermore, these are limited in the number of targets that can be predicted, do not estimate which target predictions are more reliable and/or lack comprehensive retrospective validations. We present MolTarPred ( http://moltarpred.marseille.inserm.fr/), a user-friendly web tool for predicting protein targets of small organic compounds. It is powered by a large knowledge base comprising 607,659 compounds and 4,553 macromolecular targets collected from the ChEMBL database. In about 1 min, the predicted targets for the supplied molecule will be listed in a table. The chemical structures of the query molecule and the most similar compounds annotated with the predicted target will also be shown to permit visual inspection and comparison. Practical examples of the use of MolTarPred are showcased. MolTarPred is a new resource for scientists that require a more complete knowledge of the polypharmacology of a molecule. The introduction of a reliability score constitutes an attractive functionality of MolTarPred, as it permits focusing experimental confirmatory tests on the most reliable predictions, which leads to higher prospective hit rates.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

31106379,Drug ReposER: a web server for predicting similar amino acid arrangements to known drug binding interfaces for potential drug repositioning.,"A common drug repositioning strategy is the re-application of an existing drug to address alternative targets. A crucial aspect to enable such repurposing is that the drug's binding site on the original target is similar to that on the alternative target. Based on the assumption that proteins with similar binding sites may bind to similar drugs, the 3D substructure similarity data can be used to identify similar sites in other proteins that are not known targets. The Drug ReposER (DRug REPOSitioning Exploration Resource) web server is designed to identify potential targets for drug repurposing based on sub-structural similarity to the binding interfaces of known drug binding sites. The application has pre-computed amino acid arrangements from protein structures in the Protein Data Bank that are similar to the 3D arrangements of known drug binding sites thus allowing users to explore them as alternative targets. Users can annotate new structures for sites that are similarly arranged to the residues found in known drug binding interfaces. The search results are presented as mappings of matched sidechain superpositions. The results of the searches can be visualized using an integrated NGL viewer.

These methods require the initial assignment of NMR signals to particular atoms in the sequence of the protein, a step that can be very time-consuming. The probabilistic interaction network of evidence (PINE) algorithm for automated assignment of backbone and side chain chemical shifts utilizes a Bayesian probabilistic network model that analyzes sequence data and peak lists from multiple NMR experiments.

31318409,PTM-Logo: a program for generation of sequence logos based on position-specific background amino-acid probabilities.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Identification of the amino-acid motifs in proteins that are targeted for post-translational modifications (PTMs) is of great importance in understanding regulatory networks. Information about targeted motifs can be derived from mass spectrometry data that identify peptides containing specific PTMs such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and acetylation. Comparison of input data against a standardized 'background' set allows identification of over- and under-represented amino acids surrounding the modified site. Conventionally, calculation of targeted motifs assumes a random background distribution of amino acids surrounding the modified position. However, we show that probabilities of amino acids depend on (i) the type of the modification and (ii) their positions relative to the modified site. Thus, software that identifies such over- and under-represented amino acids should make appropriate adjustments for these effects. Here we present a new program, PTM-Logo, that generates representations of these amino acid preferences ('logos') based on position-specific amino-acid probability backgrounds calculated either from user-input data or curated databases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PTM-Logo is freely available online at http://sysbio.chula.ac.th/PTMLogo/ or https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/PTMLogo/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

Photosynthetic organisms, and plants especially, have established complex programs that coordinate physiological, metabolic and developmental processes with the changing light. The diurnal regulation of the underlying transcriptional processes is observed when groups of functionally related genes (gene modules) are expressed at a specific time of the day. However, studying the diurnal regulation of these gene modules in the plant kingdom was hampered by the large amount of data required for the analyses. To meet this need, we used gene expression data from 17 diurnal studies spanning the whole Archaeplastida kingdom (Plantae kingdom in the broad sense) to make an online diurnal database. We have equipped the database with tools that allow user-friendly cross-species comparisons of gene expression profiles, entire co-expression networks, co-expressed clusters (involved in specific biological processes), time-specific gene expression and others. We exemplify how these tools can be used by studying three important biological questions: (i) the evolution of cell division, (ii) the diurnal control of gene modules in algae and (iii) the conservation of diurnally controlled modules across species.

31664036,Prenatal hypoxia-induced epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in rat fetal and adult offspring hearts.,"The molecular mechanism of antenatal hypoxia impacting on fetal heart development and elevated risk of heart disease of adult offspring is poorly understood. We present a dataset integrating DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses of antenatal hypoxia affecting rat fetal and adult offspring hearts to understand hypoxia-mediated epigenomic reprogramming of the heart development. We showed that antenatal hypoxia not only induced DNA methylomic and transcriptomic changes in the fetal hearts, but also had a delayed and lasting effect on the adult offspring hearts. Of interest, antenatal hypoxia induced opposite changes in DNA methylation patterns in fetal and adult hearts, with a hypermethylation in the fetus and a hypomethylation in the adult. An extensive preprocessing, quality assessment, and downstream data analyses were performed on the genomic dataset so that the research community may take advantage of the public resource. These dataset could be exploited as a comprehensive resource for understanding fetal hypoxia-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in the heart development and further developmental programming of heart vulnerability to disease later in life.Figshare doi: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9948572.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The candidate pathways identified from C. elegans study were also confirmed using vertebrate model, zebrafish, Danio rerio and human relevance was then inferred using Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) analysis. Prior to evaluating the toxicity, label-free Raman mapping was conducted to investigate whether or not the organisms could uptake HDPE. C. elegans transcription factor RNAi screening results showed that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Œ≤) signaling pathways were significantly associated with HDPE exposure, which was also confirmed in zebrafish model. Gene-disease interaction analysis using the CTD revealed the possible human health implications of microplastics. Finally, based on this finding, related AOPs were identified from AOP Wiki (http://aopwiki.org), which are ""Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors Œ≥ inactivation leading to lung fibrosis"" and ""AFB1: Mutagenic Mode-of-Action leading to Hepatocellular Carcinoma"".

31829207,Genepanel.iobio - an easy to use web tool for generating disease- and phenotype-associated gene lists.,"When ordering genetic testing or triaging candidate variants in exome and genome sequencing studies, it is critical to generate and test a comprehensive list of candidate genes that succinctly describe the complete and objective phenotypic features of disease. Significant efforts have been made to curate gene:disease associations both in academic research and commercial genetic testing laboratory settings. However, many of these valuable resources exist as islands and must be used independently, generating static, single-resource gene:disease association lists. Here we describe genepanel.iobio (https://genepanel.iobio.io) an easy to use, free and open-source web tool for generating disease- and phenotype-associated gene lists from multiple gene:disease association resources, including the NCBI Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), Phenolyzer, and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We demonstrate the utility of genepanel.iobio by applying it to complex, rare and undiagnosed disease cases that had reached a diagnostic conclusion. We find that genepanel.iobio is able to correctly prioritize the gene containing the diagnostic variant in roughly half of these challenging cases. Importantly, each component resource contributed diagnostic value, showing the benefits of this aggregate approach. We expect genepanel.iobio will improve the ease and diagnostic value of generating gene:disease association lists for genetic test ordering and whole genome or exome sequencing variant prioritization.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
31830251,FFLtool: a web server for transcription factor and miRNA feed forward loop analysis in human.,"SUMMARY:Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are two kinds of important regulators for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. Understanding cross-talks between the two regulators and their targets is critical to reveal complex molecular regulatory mechanisms. Here, we developed FFLtool, a web server for detecting potential feed forward loop (FFL) of TF-miRNA-target regulation in human. In FFLtool, we integrated comprehensive regulations of TF-target and miRNA-target, and developed two functional modules: (i) The 'FFL Analysis' module can detect potential FFLs and internal regulatory networks in a user-defined gene set. FFLtool also provides three levels of evidence to illustrate the reliability for each FFL and enrichment functions for co-target genes of the same TF and miRNA; (ii) The 'Browse FFLs' module displays FFLs comprised of differentially or specifically expressed TFs and miRNAs and their target genes in cancers. FFLtool is a valuable resource for investigating gene expression regulation and mechanism study in biological processes and diseases.

However, limited intra-individual variability is a precondition for targeted dosing and the diagnosis of SI.<h4>Methods</h4>In the AIEOP-BFM acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 2009 trial, 2771 children with ALL were included and underwent ASNase-TDM in a central laboratory in M√ºnster. Two biweekly administrations of pegylated ASNase during induction and a third dose during reinduction or the high-risk block, which was administered several weeks later, were monitored. We calculated (1) the incidence of SI; and (2) the predictivity of SI for SI after the subsequent administration. ASNase activities monitored during induction were categorized into percentiles at the respective sampling time points. These percentiles were used to calculate the intra-individual range of percentiles as a surrogate for intrapatient variability and to evaluate the predictivity of ASNase activity for the subsequent administration.<h4>Results</h4>The overall incidence of SI was low (4.9%). The positive predictive value of SI identified by one sample was ‚â§21%. Confirmation of SI by a second sample indicated a high positive predictive value of 100% for biweekly administrations, but not for administration more than 17 weeks later. Sampling and/or documentation errors were risks for misdiagnosis of SI. High intra-individual variability in ASNase activities, with ranges of percentiles over more than 2 quartiles and low predictivity, was observed in approximately 25% of the patients. These patients were likely to fail dose individualization based on TDM data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To use TDM as a basis for clinical decisions, standardized clinical procedures are required and high intra-individual variability should be taken into account.

Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology, methylated cytosine sites can be revealed at the single nucleotide level. However, the WGBS data analysis process is usually complicated and challenging.<h4>Results</h4>To alleviate the associated difficulties, we integrated the WGBS data processing steps and downstream analysis into a two-phase approach. First, we set up the required tools in Galaxy and developed workflows to calculate the methylation level from raw WGBS data and generate a methylation status summary, the mtable. This computation environment is wrapped into the Docker container image DocMethyl, which allows users to rapidly deploy an executable environment without tedious software installation and library dependency problems. Next, the mtable files were uploaded to the web server EpiMOLAS_web to link with the gene annotation databases that enable rapid data retrieval and analyses.<h4>Conclusion</h4>To our knowledge, the EpiMOLAS framework, consisting of DocMethyl and EpiMOLAS_web, is the first approach to include containerization technology and a web-based system for WGBS data analysis from raw data processing to downstream analysis. EpiMOLAS will help users cope with their WGBS data and also conduct reproducible analyses of publicly available data, thereby gaining insights into the mechanisms underlying complex biological phenomenon.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as genes that appeared at least three times with p values <0.05 and a fold change of ‚â•50% (|log2FC| ‚â• 0.58). Hub genes were identified by evaluating the following parameters using a protein-protein interaction network: node degrees, betweenness, and eigenfactor scores. Hub genes and the top-40 DEGs by |log2FC| were used to generate a Venn diagram, and key genes were identified. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. Information on ovarian cancer patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed, and the effect of topotecan on the protein expression was examined by Western blotting.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven topotecan signatures were downloaded, and 65 upregulated and 87 downregulated DEGs were identified. Twenty-one hub genes were identified. We identified eight key genes as upregulated genes, including NFKBIA, IKBKB, GADD45A, CDKN1A, and HIST2H2BE, while EZH2, CDC20, and CDK7 were identified as downregulated genes, which play critical roles in the cell cycle and carcinogenesis in KEGG analysis. In the TCGA analysis, the CDKN1A+/EZH2- group had the longest median survival, while the CDKN1A-/EZH2+ group had the shortest median survival. Topotecan-treated murine ovarian (MOSEC), colorectal (CT26), and lung (LLC) cancer cell lines displayed upregulated CDKN1A encoding p21 and downregulated Ezh2.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using publicly accessible bioinformatics tools, we evaluated key genes and pathways related to topotecan and examined the key genes using the TCGA database and in vitro studies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not descriptive of resource

METHODS:We extracted summary-level data for MDD, type 2 diabetes, CAD and heart failure from corresponding published large genome-wide association studies of individuals mainly of European-descent. In total, 96 SNPs for MDD, 202 SNPs for type 2 diabetes, 44 SNPs for CAD and 12 SNPs for heart failure were proposed as instrumental variables at the genome-wide significance level (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ5‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-8). The random-effects inverse-variance weighted method was used for the main analyses. RESULTS:Genetic liability to MDD was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes and CAD at the Bonferroni-corrected significance level. The ORs of type 2 diabetes and CAD were respectively 1.26 (95% CI 1.10, 1.43; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ6‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ10-4) and 1.16 (95% CI 1.05, 1.29; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0047) per one-unit increase in loge odds of MDD. There was a suggestive association between MDD and heart failure (OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.01, 1.21]; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.033). We found limited evidence supporting causal effects of cardiometabolic diseases on MDD risk in the reverse MR analyses. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION:The present study strengthened the evidence that MDD is a potential risk factor for type 2 diabetes and CAD. Whether MDD is causally related to heart failure needs further study. DATA AVAILABILITY:All data included in this study were uploaded as supplements and are also publicly available through published GWASs and open GWAS datasets (UK Biobank, 23andMe and Psychiatric Genomics: https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3203; DIAGRAM: http://diagram-consortium.org/downloads.html; CARDIoGRAMplusCD4: www.cardiogramplusc4d.org/; HERMES: http://www.kp4cd.org/datasets/mi).

32271876,MODifieR: an Ensemble R Package for Inference of Disease Modules from Transcriptomics Networks.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Complex diseases are due to the dense interactions of many disease-associated factors that dysregulate genes that in turn form the so-called disease modules, which have shown to be a powerful concept for understanding pathological mechanisms. There exist many disease module inference methods that rely on somewhat different assumptions, but there is still no gold standard or best-performing method. Hence, there is a need for combining these methods to generate robust disease modules.<h4>Results</h4>We developed MODule IdentiFIER (MODifieR), an ensemble R package of nine disease module inference methods from transcriptomics networks. MODifieR uses standardized input and output allowing the possibility to combine individual modules generated from these methods into more robust disease-specific modules, contributing to a better understanding of complex diseases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MODifieR is available under the GNU GPL license and can be freely downloaded from https://gitlab.com/Gustafsson-lab/MODifieR and as a Docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/ddeweerd/modifier.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
32286627,rMAPS2: an update of the RNA map analysis and plotting server for alternative splicing regulation.,"The rMAPS2 (RNA Map Analysis and Plotting Server 2) web server, freely available at http://rmaps.cecsresearch.org/, has provided the high-throughput sequencing data research community with curated tools for the identification of RNA binding protein sites. rMAPS2 analyzes differential alternative splicing or CLIP peak data obtained from high-throughput sequencing data analysis tools like MISO, rMATS, Piranha, PIPE-CLIP and PARalyzer, and then, graphically displays enriched RNA-binding protein target sites. The initial release of rMAPS focused only on the most common alternative splicing event, skipped exon or exon skipping. However, there was a high demand for the analysis of other major types of alternative splicing events, especially for retained intron events since this is the most common type of alternative splicing in plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we expanded the implementation of rMAPS2 to facilitate analyses for all five major types of alternative splicing events: skipped exon, mutually exclusive exons, alternative 5' splice site, alternative 3' splice site and retained intron. In addition, by employing multi-threading, rMAPS2 has vastly improved the user experience with significant reductions in running time, ‚àº3.5 min for the analysis of all five major alternative splicing types at once.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

32299846,Pilot Study of Return of Genetic Results to Patients in Adult Nephrology.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Actionable genetic findings have implications for care of patients with kidney disease, and genetic testing is an emerging tool in nephrology practice. However, there are scarce data regarding best practices for return of results and clinical application of actionable genetic findings for kidney patients.<h4>Design, setting, participants, & measurements</h4>We developed a return of results workflow in collaborations with clinicians for the retrospective recontact of adult nephrology patients who had been recruited into a biobank research study for exome sequencing and were identified to have medically actionable genetic findings.<h4>Results</h4>Using this workflow, we attempted to recontact a diverse pilot cohort of 104 nephrology research participants with actionable genetic findings, encompassing 34 different monogenic etiologies of nephropathy and five single-gene disorders recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for return as medically actionable secondary findings. We successfully recontacted 64 (62%) participants and returned results to 41 (39%) individuals. In each case, the genetic diagnosis had meaningful implications for the patients' nephrology care. Through implementation efforts and qualitative interviews with providers, we identified over 20 key challenges associated with returning results to study participants, and found that physician knowledge gaps in genomics was a recurrent theme. We iteratively addressed these challenges to yield an optimized workflow, which included standardized consultation notes with tailored management recommendations, monthly educational conferences on core topics in genomics, and a curated list of expert clinicians for patients requiring extranephrologic referrals.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Developing the infrastructure to support return of genetic results in nephrology was resource-intensive, but presented potential opportunities for improving patient care.<h4>Podcast</h4>This article contains a podcast at https://www.asn-online.org/media/podcast/CJASN/2020_04_16_12481019.mp3.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,podcast
32312909,Optimizing Resources in Children's Surgical Care: An Update on the American College of Surgeons' Verification Program.,"Surgical procedures are performed in the United States in a wide variety of clinical settings and with variation in clinical outcomes. In May 2012, the Task Force for Children's Surgical Care, an ad hoc multidisciplinary group comprising physicians representing specialties relevant to pediatric perioperative care, was convened to generate recommendations to optimize the delivery of children's surgical care. This group generated a white paper detailing the consensus opinions of the involved experts. Following these initial recommendations, the American College of Surgeons (ACS), Children's Hospital Association, and Task Force for Children's Surgical Care, with input from all related perioperative specialties, developed and published specific and detailed resource and quality standards designed to improve children's surgical care (https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/childrens-surgery/childrens-surgery-verification). In 2015, with the endorsement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/135/6/e1538), the ACS established a pilot verification program. In January 2017, after completion of the pilot program, the ACS Children's Surgery Verification Quality Improvement Program was officially launched. Verified sites are listed on the program Web site at https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/childrens-surgery/childrens-surgery-verification/centers, and more than 150 are interested in verification.

32324845,alona: a web server for single-cell RNA-seq analysis.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a technology to measure gene expression in single cells. It has enabled discovery of new cell types and established cell type atlases of tissues and organs. The widespread adoption of scRNA-seq has created a need for user-friendly software for data analysis. We have developed a web server, alona that incorporates several of the most popular single-cell analysis algorithms into a flexible pipeline. alona can perform quality filtering, normalization, batch correction, clustering, cell type annotation and differential gene expression analysis. Data are visualized in the web browser using an interface based on JavaScript, allowing the user to query genes of interest and visualize the cluster structure. alona accepts a compressed gene expression matrix and identifies cell clusters with a graph-based clustering strategy. Cell types are identified from a comprehensive collection of marker genes or by specifying a custom set of marker genes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The service runs at https://alona.panglaodb.se and the Python package can be downloaded from https://oscar-franzen.github.io/adobo/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
32347334,Retrograde intrarenal surgery of renal stones: a critical multi-aspect evaluation of the outcomes by the Turkish Academy of Urology Prospective Study Group (ACUP Study).,"<h4>Aims</h4>To outline and evaluate the incidence, management and follow-up of the residual fragments (RFs) following retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) of renal stones by the Turkish Academy of Urology Prospective Study Group (ACUP Study).<h4>Methods</h4>Following the ethical committee approval, 15 centers providing data regarding the incidence, management, and follow-up of RFs after RIRS were included and all relevant information was recorded into the same electronic database program ( https://acup.uroturk.org.tr/ ) created by Turkish Urology Academy for Residual Stone Study.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1112 cases underwent RIRS for renal calculi and RFs were observed in 276 cases (24.8%). Of all the parameters evaluated, our results demonstrated no statistically significant relation between preoperative DJ stenting and the presence of RFs (œá2 (1)‚Äâ=‚Äâ158.418; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.099). RFs were significantly higher in patients treated with UAS (82 patients, 29.3%) during the procedure compared to the cases who did not receive UAS (194 patients, 23.3%) (œá2 (1)‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.999; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.046). The mean period for a secondary intervention after RIRS was 28.39 (¬±‚Äâ12.52) days. Regarding the procedures applied for RF removal, re-RIRS was the most commonly performed approach (56%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the reported safe and successful outcomes, the incidence of RFs is higher, after the RIRS procedure particularly in cases with relatively larger calculi. Such cases need to be followed in a close manner and although a second flexible ureteroscopy is the treatment of choice for fragment removal in the majority of these patients, shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy may also be preferred in selected cases.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,clinical; not descriptive of resource
32367143,"Not just a research method: If used with caution, can job-exposure matrices be a useful tool in the practice of occupational medicine and public health?","The recent editorial by Dr Susan Peters ""Although a valuable method in occupational epidemiology, job-exposure matrices are no magic fix"" ably describes the strengths and limitations of job-exposure matrix (JEM) approaches in occupational epidemiology research (1). In addition to their use in research, we would like to add that JEM may also be of use in compensation and surveillance efforts in occupational health. JEM could assist the compensation process by supporting the assessment of relevant exposures related to specific health conditions (2). The potential usefulness of a JEM as a decision tool for compensation of work-related musculoskeletal disorders has been examined (3). Because occupational diseases are often under-recognized, another practical application is using a JEM to screen for occupational exposures as part of health surveillance. Use of JEM to screen for asbestos and wood dust exposure in the clinical setting has shown promising results (4-6). By summarizing multiple exposures at a job level (7), JEM may also assist policy-makers in setting priorities for hazards and controls at work, as well as occupational practitioners to target prevention efforts and direct the conduct of more precise exposure measures to particular jobs. Sharing JEM across different countries may be useful in providing estimates of exposures across larger populations to calculate global burden of disease related to occupational exposure. The JEMINI (JEM InterNatIonal) initiative was launched to explore the possibility of developing international JEM that could be used across countries (8). Beginning with physical (biomechanical) exposures, this open group has started homogenizing job coding systems and comparing some available JEM. Estimating differences in the level of exposure between countries will require much more work, without guaranteed success. As Peters mentioned, many limitations exist in the use of JEM. Users of JEM must consider the source of exposure data - expert assessments, data collected from individual workers, or environmental sampling. The coding of occupations is time consuming and can introduce error (9), and more testing of and comparison with automated job coding systems is needed (10). JEM reflect an ""average"" level of exposure within a job at the expense of individual variation. At population level, JEM can offer a useful estimate of exposures. If used at an individual level in a clinical or compensation setting, JEM cannot replace the professionals involved in exposure assessment but may help them focus their action more effectively on complex situations that require their expertise. In conclusion, these JEM developed for research might also be used as a public health tool, provided that their limitations are properly taken into account. References 1. Peters S.

32427333,webPSN v2.0: a webserver to infer fingerprints of structural communication in biomacromolecules.,"A mixed Protein Structure Network (PSN) and Elastic Network Model-Normal Mode Analysis (ENM-NMA)-based strategy (i.e. PSN-ENM) was developed to investigate structural communication in bio-macromolecules. Protein Structure Graphs (PSGs) are computed on a single structure, whereas information on system dynamics is supplied by ENM-NMA. The approach was implemented in a webserver (webPSN), which was significantly updated herein. The webserver now handles both proteins and nucleic acids and relies on an internal upgradable database of network parameters for ions and small molecules in all PDB structures. Apart from the radical restyle of the server and some changes in the calculation setup, other major novelties concern the possibility to: a) compute the differences in nodes, links, and communication pathways between two structures (i.e. network difference) and b) infer links, hubs, communities, and metapaths from consensus networks computed on a number of structures. These new features are useful to identify commonalties and differences between two different functional states of the same system or structural-communication signatures in homologous or analogous systems. The output analysis relies on 3D-representations, interactive tables and graphs, also available for download. Speed and accuracy make this server suitable to comparatively investigate structural communication in large sets of bio-macromolecular systems.

32459325,PaCRISPR: a server for predicting and visualizing anti-CRISPR proteins.,"Anti-CRISPRs are widespread amongst bacteriophage and promote bacteriophage infection by inactivating the bacterial host's CRISPR-Cas defence system. Identifying and characterizing anti-CRISPR proteins opens an avenue to explore and control CRISPR-Cas machineries for the development of new CRISPR-Cas based biotechnological and therapeutic tools. Past studies have identified anti-CRISPRs in several model phage genomes, but a challenge exists to comprehensively screen for anti-CRISPRs accurately and efficiently from genome and metagenome sequence data. Here, we have developed an ensemble learning based predictor, PaCRISPR, to accurately identify anti-CRISPRs from protein datasets derived from genome and metagenome sequencing projects. PaCRISPR employs different types of feature recognition united within an ensemble framework. Extensive cross-validation and independent tests show that PaCRISPR achieves a significantly more accurate performance compared with homology-based baseline predictors and an existing toolkit. The performance of PaCRISPR was further validated in discovering anti-CRISPRs that were not part of the training for PaCRISPR, but which were recently demonstrated to function as anti-CRISPRs for phage infections. Data visualization on anti-CRISPR relationships, highlighting sequence similarity and phylogenetic considerations, is part of the output from the PaCRISPR toolkit, which is freely available at http://pacrispr.erc.monash.edu/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,no but a nice visualization dashboard
32467965,AOP4EUpest: mapping of pesticides in adverse outcome pathways using a text mining tool.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Exposure to pesticides may lead to adverse health effects in human populations, in particular vulnerable groups. The main long-term health concerns are neurodevelopmental disorders, carcinogenicity as well as endocrine disruption possibly leading to reproductive and metabolic disorders. Adverse outcome pathways (AOP) consist in linear representations of mechanistic perturbations at different levels of the biological organization. Although AOPs are chemical-agnostic, they can provide a better understanding of the Mode of Action of pesticides and can support a rational identification of effect markers.<h4>Results</h4>With the increasing amount of scientific literature and the development of biological databases, investigation of putative links between pesticides, from various chemical groups and AOPs using the biological events present in the AOP-Wiki database is now feasible. To identify co-occurrence between a specific pesticide and a biological event in scientific abstracts from the PubMed database, we used an updated version of the artificial intelligence-based AOP-helpFinder tool. This allowed us to decipher multiple links between the studied substances and molecular initiating events, key events and adverse outcomes. These results were collected, structured and presented in a web application named AOP4EUpest that can support regulatory assessment of the prioritized pesticides and trigger new epidemiological and experimental studies.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://www.biomedicale.parisdescartes.fr/aop4EUpest/home.php.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

32615035,mycoCSM: Using Graph-Based Signatures to Identify Safe Potent Hits against Mycobacteria.,"Development of new potent, safe drugs to treat Mycobacteria has proven to be challenging, with limited hit rates of initial screens restricting subsequent development efforts. Despite significant efforts and the evolution of quantitative structure-activity relationship as well as machine learning-based models for computationally predicting molecule bioactivity, there is an unmet need for efficient and reliable methods for identifying biologically active compounds against Mycobacterium that are also safe for humans. Here we developed mycoCSM, a graph-based signature approach to rapidly identify compounds likely to be active against bacteria from the genus Mycobacterium, or against specific Mycobacteria species. mycoCSM was trained and validated on eight organism-specific and for the first time a general Mycobacteria data set, achieving correlation coefficients of up to 0.89 on cross-validation and 0.88 on independent blind tests, when predicting bioactivity in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration. In addition, we also developed a predictor to identify those compounds likely to penetrate in necrotic tuberculosis foci, which achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.75. Together with a built-in estimator of the maximum tolerated dose in humans, we believe this method will provide a valuable resource to enrich screening libraries with potent, safe molecules. To provide simple guidance in the selection of libraries with favorable anti-Mycobacteria properties, we made mycoCSM freely available online at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/myco_csm.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32626907,Comments on a recent case-control study of malignant mesothelioma of the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis testis.,"As the first case-control study of malignant mesothelioma of the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis testis (mTVT), the paper by Marinaccio et al (1) is potentially an important epidemiologic contribution. A careful review of the paper, however, raises a number of methodological issues. Any case-control study can be viewed as being nested within a conceptual cohort, with controls being sampled from the at-risk cohort as cases arise over time. This view of case-control studies leads to the concept of incidence-density sampling of controls (eg, 2, 3). For Marinaccio et al (1) this would mean that, as cases were registered over the study period, each would be matched to an individual control or set of controls of the same gender, age, and region of the country (since asbestos exposure varies by time and region [4]). For example, if a case were 50 years old in 1995, then any matched control should be close to age 50 in 1995 and of the same gender and from the same region as the case. Matching for age in this fashion automatically results in matching for year of birth, which is essential in this context because birth-cohort effects are determinants of asbestos exposure and mesothelioma incidence (eg, 5-8). If Marinaccio et al (1) used this scheme for age-matching, one would expect to see similar distributions of cases (table 1) and controls (table S3 in the supplemental material) by period of birth. Among males, however, the distributions of mesothelioma cases (whether pericardial or mTVT) and controls by period of birth are clearly different (P<0.001). Among females, the distributions of cases of pericardial mesothelioma and controls by birth year are less dissimilar (P‚âà0.05). Thus, the female cases of pericardial mesothelioma are better matched to controls on year of birth than are male cases of either mTVT or pericardial mesothelioma. We note also that the distributions of male and female controls by year of birth are distinctly different (P<0.002), whereas the birth-year distributions of cases of mesothelioma by site and gender are not (P‚âà0.8). In the Marinaccio et al (1) sensitivity analysis restricted to subjects born before 1950, the distributions of cases and controls by period of birth remain significantly different. Therefore, based on the reported evidence, cases and controls were not matched on birth cohort, thereby possibly biasing the results. Similarly, bias may result from the lack of matching on geographic region; while cases were registered from across Italy, controls were selected from only six regions. Although a sensitivity analysis restricted cases and controls to those from only the six regions, a comparison of tables S1 and S3 indicates that the regional distribution of controls is different from that of person-time observed; that is, the controls do not appear to be representative of the underlying population at risk by region. The second major issue of concern has to do with ascertainment of asbestos exposure. Information on exposure for the cases was presumably obtained at the time of registration. The two sets of controls, obtained from previously unpublished case-control studies, were interviewed during 2014-2015 and 2014-2016; that is, many years after the exposure for most cases was ascertained (1993-2015). Few other details of the control groups are provided, except that participation by one set of controls was <50%, raising additional concerns about selection bias. For details on the second set of controls, Marinaccio et al (1) reference a paper by Brandi et al (9). On review of that paper, however, we found no description of the control group, only references to three earlier papers. Marinaccio et al (1) present analyses only with both sets of controls combined; to evaluate potential sources of bias from the use of different sets of controls, they should also report results using each set of controls separately. The authors also did not detail their methods of exposure classification. For example, what does probable or possible exposure mean? The authors should at least present separate analyses of definite occupational exposure. Eighty cases of mTVT were registered, but only 68 were included in the analyses. Information on the 12 omitted cases (eg, age, year of birth, and region) would be helpful. Marinaccio et al (1) did not provide clear information on what occupations and/or industries they considered as exposed to asbestos. In an earlier study, Marinaccio et al (10) remarked on the absence of pericardial mesothelioma and mTVT in industries with the highest exposures to asbestos, saying, ""[t]he absence of exposures in the shipbuilding, railway and asbestos-cement industries ‚Ä¶ for all the 67 pericardial and testicular cases is noteworthy but not easy to interpret."" By contrast, Marinaccio et al (1) stated, ""[t]he economic sectors more frequently associated with asbestos exposure were construction, steel mills, metal-working industry, textile industry and agriculture."" The possibility of exposure in the ""agriculture economic sector"" was not mentioned in Marinaccio et al (10) and appears not to have been considered in previous epidemiologic studies in Italy. In general, epidemiologic studies indicate that farmers and agricultural workers are not at increased risk of developing mesothelioma (eg, 11-17). The fact that few, if any, cases of mTVT and pericardial mesothelioma occurred in industries traditionally associated with high asbestos exposure raises the possibility that the results of Marinaccio et al (1) are attributable to deficiencies in study design, very possibly bias in the selection of controls, and deficiencies in exposure assessment and classification as described above, leading to a spurious association of occupational exposure with mTVT and male pericardial mesothelioma.

32657416,MutCombinator: identification of mutated peptides allowing combinatorial mutations using nucleotide-based graph search.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Proteogenomics has proven its utility by integrating genomics and proteomics. Typical approaches use data from next-generation sequencing to infer proteins expressed. A sample-specific protein sequence database is often adopted to identify novel peptides from matched mass spectrometry-based proteomics; nevertheless, there is no software that can practically identify all possible forms of mutated peptides suggested by various genomic information sources.<h4>Results</h4>We propose MutCombinator, which enables us to practically identify mutated peptides from tandem mass spectra allowing combinatorial mutations during the database search. It uses an upgraded version of a variant graph, keeping track of frame information. The variant graph is indexed by nine nucleotides for fast access. Using MutCombinator, we could identify more mutated peptides than previous methods, because combinations of point mutations are considered and also because it can be practically applied together with a large mutation database such as COSMIC. Furthermore, MutCombinator supports in-frame search for coding regions and three-frame search for non-coding regions.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://prix.hanyang.ac.kr/download/mutcombinator.jsp.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
32696040,Metasubtract: an R-package to analytically produce leave-one-out meta-analysis GWAS summary statistics.,"<h4>Summary</h4>statistics from a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (meta-GWAS) can be used for many follow-up analyses. One valuable application is the creation of polygenic scores. However, if polygenic scores are calculated in a validation cohort that was part of the meta-GWAS consortium, this cohort is not independent and analyses will therefore yield inflated results. The R package 'MetaSubtract' was developed to subtract the results of the validation cohort from meta-GWAS summary statistics analytically. The statistical formulas for a meta-analysis were inverted to compute corrected summary statistics of a meta-GWAS leaving one (or more) cohort(s) out. These formulas have been implemented in MetaSubtract for different meta-analyses methods (fixed effects inverse variance or square root sample size weighted z-score) accounting for no, single or double genomic control correction. Results obtained by MetaSubtract correlate very well to those calculated using the traditional way, i.e. by performing a meta-analysis leaving out the validation cohort. In conclusion, MetaSubtract allows researchers to compute meta-GWAS summary statistics that are independent of the GWAS results of the validation cohort without requiring access to the cohort level GWAS results of the corresponding meta-GWAS consortium.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MetaSubtract.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

32734663,The Bio3D packages for structural bioinformatics.,"Bio3D is a family of R packages for the analysis of biomolecular sequence, structure, and dynamics. Major functionality includes biomolecular database searching and retrieval, sequence and structure conservation analysis, ensemble normal mode analysis, protein structure and correlation network analysis, principal component, and related multivariate analysis methods. Here, we review recent package developments, including a new underlying segregation into separate packages for distinct analysis, and introduce a new method for structure analysis named ensemble difference distance matrix analysis (eDDM). The eDDM approach calculates and compares atomic distance matrices across large sets of homologous atomic structures to help identify the residue wise determinants underlying specific functional processes. An eDDM workflow is detailed along with an example application to a large protein family. As a new member of the Bio3D family, the Bio3D-eddm package supports both experimental and theoretical simulation-generated structures, is integrated with other methods for dissecting sequence-structure-function relationships, and can be used in a highly automated and reproducible manner. Bio3D is distributed as an integrated set of platform independent open source R packages available from: http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
32742675,Network-based protein structural classification.,"Experimental determination of protein function is resource-consuming. As an alternative, computational prediction of protein function has received attention. In this context, protein structural classification (PSC) can help, by allowing for determining structural classes of currently unclassified proteins based on their features, and then relying on the fact that proteins with similar structures have similar functions. Existing PSC approaches rely on sequence-based or direct three-dimensional (3D) structure-based protein features. By contrast, we first model 3D structures of proteins as protein structure networks (PSNs). Then, we use network-based features for PSC. We propose the use of graphlets, state-of-the-art features in many research areas of network science, in the task of PSC. Moreover, because graphlets can deal only with unweighted PSNs, and because accounting for edge weights when constructing PSNs could improve PSC accuracy, we also propose a deep learning framework that automatically learns network features from weighted PSNs. When evaluated on a large set of approximately 9400 CATH and approximately 12 800 SCOP protein domains (spanning 36 PSN sets), the best of our proposed approaches are superior to existing PSC approaches in terms of accuracy, with comparable running times.

32749460,Development of an online tool for linking behavior change techniques and mechanisms of action based on triangulation of findings from literature synthesis and expert consensus.,"Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers develop interventions to change behavior based on their understanding of how behavior change techniques (BCTs) impact the determinants of behavior. A transparent, systematic, and accessible method of linking BCTs with the processes through which they change behavior (i.e., their mechanisms of action [MoAs]) would advance the understanding of intervention effects and improve theory and intervention development. The purpose of this study is to triangulate evidence for hypothesized BCT-MoA links obtained in two previous studies and present the results in an interactive, online tool. Two previous studies generated evidence on links between 56 BCTs and 26 MoAs based on their frequency in literature synthesis and on expert consensus. Concordance between the findings of the two studies was examined using multilevel modeling. Uncertainties and differences between the two studies were reconciled by 16 behavior change experts using consensus development methods. The resulting evidence was used to generate an online tool. The two studies showed concordance for 25 of the 26 MoAs and agreement for 37 links and for 460 ""nonlinks."" A further 55 links were resolved by consensus (total of 92 [37 + 55] hypothesized BCT-MoA links). Full data on 1,456 possible links was incorporated into the online interactive Theory and Technique Tool (https://theoryandtechniquetool.humanbehaviourchange.org/). This triangulation of two distinct sources of evidence provides guidance on how BCTs may affect the mechanisms that change behavior and is available as a resource for behavior change intervention designers, researchers and theorists, supporting intervention design, research synthesis, and collaborative research.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not life sci - questable if underlying data is available
32753773,hubViz: A Novel Tool for Hub-centric Visualization.,"Visualization algorithms have been widely used for intuitive interrogation of genomic data and popularly used tools include MDS, t-SNE, and UMAP. However, these algorithms are not tuned for the visualization of binary data and none of them consider the hubness of observations for the visualization. In order to address these limitations, here we propose hubViz, a novel tool for hub-centric visualization of binary data. We evaluated the performance of hubViz with its application to the gene expression data measured in multiple brain regions of rats exposed to cocaine, the single-cell RNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with interferon beta, and the literature mining data to investigate relationships among diseases. We further evaluated the performance of hubViz using simulation studies. We showed that hubViz provides effective visual inspection by locating the hub in the center and the contrasting elements in the opposite sides around the center. We believe that hubViz and its software can be powerful tools that can improve visualizations of various genomic data. The hubViz is implemented as an R package hubviz, which is publicly available at https://dongjunchung.github.io/hubviz/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
32773643,Genomic variance of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and Spike protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).,"<h4>Background</h4>The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused severe pneumonia at December 2019. Since then, it has been wildly spread from Wuhan, China, to Asia, European, and United States to become the pandemic worldwide. Now coronavirus disease 2019 were globally diagnosed over 3 084 740 cases with mortality of 212 561 toll. Current reports variants are found in SARS-CoV-2, majoring in functional ribonucleic acid (RNA) to transcribe into structural proteins as transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein holds the virus RNA genome; the envelope (E) and membrane (M) alone with spike protein form viral envelope. The nonstructural RNA genome includes ORF1ab, ORF3, ORF6, 7a, 8, and ORF10 with highly conserved information for genome synthesis and replication in ORF1ab.<h4>Methods</h4>We apply genomic alignment analysis to observe SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/genebank/): MN 908947 (China, C1); MN985325 (United States: WA, UW); MN996527 (China, C2); MT007544 (Australia: Victoria, A1); MT027064 (United States: CA, UC); MT039890 (South Korea, K1); MT066175 (Taiwan, T1); MT066176 (Taiwan, T2); LC528232 (Japan, J1); and LC528233 (Japan, J2) and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org). We adopt Multiple Sequence Alignments web from Clustalw (https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw) and Geneious web (https://www.geneious.com.<h4>Results</h4>We analyze database by genome alignment search for nonstructural ORFs and structural E, M, N, and S proteins. Mutations in ORF1ab, ORF3, and ORF6 are observed; specific variants in spike region are detected.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We perform genomic analysis and comparative multiple sequence of SARS-CoV-2. Large scaling sequence alignments trace to localize and catch different mutant strains in United possibly to transmit severe deadly threat to humans. Studies about the biological symptom of SARS-CoV-2 in clinic animal and humans will be applied and manipulated to find mechanisms and shield the light for understanding the origin of pandemic crisis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not descriptive of resource
32777814,BSAseq: an interactive and integrated web-based workflow for identification of causal mutations in bulked F2 populations.,"<h4>Summary</h4>With the advance of next-generation sequencing technologies and reductions in the costs of these techniques, bulked segregant analysis (BSA) has become not only a powerful tool for mapping quantitative trait loci but also a useful way to identify causal gene mutations underlying phenotypes of interest. However, due to the presence of background mutations and errors in sequencing, genotyping, and reference assembly, it is often difficult to distinguish true causal mutations from background mutations. In this study, we developed the BSAseq workflow, which includes an automated bioinformatics analysis pipeline with a probabilistic model for estimating the linked region (the region linked to the causal mutation) and an interactive Shiny web application for visualizing the results. We deeply sequenced a sorghum male-sterile parental line (ms8) to capture the majority of background mutations in our bulked F2 data. We applied the workflow to 11 bulked sorghum F2 populations and 1 rice F2 population and identified the true causal mutation in each population. The workflow is intuitive and straightforward, facilitating its adoption by users without bioinformatics analysis skills. We anticipate that the BSAseq workflow will be broadly applicable to the identification of causal mutations for many phenotypes of interest.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>BSAseq is freely available on https://www.sciapps.org/page/bsa.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32778890,SurvivalMeth: a web server to investigate the effect of DNA methylation-related functional elements on prognosis.,"Aberrant DNA methylation is a fundamental characterization of epigenetics for carcinogenesis. Abnormality of DNA methylation-related functional elements (DMFEs) may lead to dysfunction of regulatory genes in the progression of cancers, contributing to prognosis of many cancers. There is an urgent need to construct a tool to comprehensively assess the impact of DMFEs on prognosis. Therefore, we developed SurvivalMeth (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/survivalmeth) to explore the prognosis-related DMFEs, which documented many kinds of DMFEs, including 309,465 CpG island-related elements, 104,748 transcript-related elements, 77,634 repeat elements, as well as cell-type specific 1,689,653 super enhancers (SE) and 1,304,902 CTCF binding regions for analysis. SurvivalMeth is a convenient tool which collected DNA methylation profiles of 36 cancers and allowed users to query their genes of interest in different datasets for prognosis. Furthermore, SurvivalMeth not only integrated different combinations, including single DMFE, multiple DMFEs, SEs and clinical data, to perform survival analysis on preupload data but also allowed for uploading customized DNA methylation profile of DMFEs from various diseases to analyze. SurvivalMeth provided a comprehensive resource and automated analysis for prognostic DMFEs, including DMFE methylation level, correlation analysis, clinical analysis, differential analysis, DMFE annotation, survival-related detailed result and visualization of survival analysis. In summary, we believe that SurvivalMeth will facilitate prognostic research of DMFEs in diverse cancers.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
32778891,MolAICal: a soft tool for 3D drug design of protein targets by artificial intelligence and classical algorithm.,"Deep learning is an important branch of artificial intelligence that has been successfully applied into medicine and two-dimensional ligand design. The three-dimensional (3D) ligand generation in the 3D pocket of protein target is an interesting and challenging issue for drug design by deep learning. Here, the MolAICal software is introduced to supply a way for generating 3D drugs in the 3D pocket of protein targets by combining with merits of deep learning model and classical algorithm. The MolAICal software mainly contains two modules for 3D drug design. In the first module of MolAICal, it employs the genetic algorithm, deep learning model trained by FDA-approved drug fragments and Vinardo score fitting on the basis of PDBbind database for drug design. In the second module, it uses deep learning generative model trained by drug-like molecules of ZINC database and molecular docking invoked by Autodock Vina automatically. Besides, the Lipinski's rule of five, Pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS), synthetic accessibility (SA) and other user-defined rules are introduced for filtering out unwanted ligands in MolAICal. To show the drug design modules of MolAICal, the membrane protein glucagon receptor and non-membrane protein SARS-CoV-2 main protease are chosen as the investigative drug targets. The results show MolAICal can generate the various and novel ligands with good binding scores and appropriate XLOGP values. We believe that MolAICal can use the advantages of deep learning model and classical programming for designing 3D drugs in protein pocket.

Data was accessed from the Archive of Data on Disability to Enable Policy and research (ADDEP). The primary analysis applied unbiased recursive partitioning to examine the relationship between serum albumin, injury severity, and long-term outcomes. The analysis is accessible via https://rpubs.com/AnhKhoaVo/586028 .<h4>Results</h4>Serum albumin concentration was significantly associated with lower extremity motor scores (LEMS) and American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade at admission to rehabilitation. Serum albumin concentrations alone were also significantly associated with change of LEMS and marked recovery (improvement of at least 2 AIS grades and/or recovery to walking) at 1-year post injury. However, after adjusting for admission to rehabilitation LEMS and AIS grade, serum albumin was not significant.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The current study partially confirms our previous observations that serum albumin concentrations are associated with neurological outcome after spinal cord injury. As a crude prognostic biomarker, serum albumin concentration could be useful in cases where injury severity cannot be accurately assessed.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Analyses for the main outcome variable of depressive symptoms were performed using a random effects repeated measures piecewise growth model to estimate trajectory shape over time on an intention-to-treat basis. Results revealed that the reduction in depressive symptoms achieved during the intervention phase continued across the follow-up period for both ACDC and UC (i.e., depressive symptoms showed a significantly decreasing trend in both groups in intervention and follow-up phases); however, no differential effects between conditions were found during the follow-up phase. The direct and indirect effects of the intervention on the other outcome variables' follow-up results were also presented. ISRCTN registry ISRCTN19700389.

32926411,Quantitative SEM characterisation of ceramic target prior and after magnetron sputtering: a case study of aluminium zinc oxide.,"Till now electron microscopy techniques have not been used to evaluate the plasma-target interactions undergone during the magnetron sputtering process. The destructive nature of this interaction severely alters the target microstructure. Utilising quantitative microscopy techniques can shed light on the complex plasma and solid-state processes involved which can ultimately lead to improved functional thin film deposition. As a representative functional material, aluminium-doped-zinc oxide (AZO) is an upcoming alternative to conventional transparent electrode wherein the process optimisation is of great importance. In this paper, we evaluate the pre- and post-sputter field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) data for ceramic AZO target fabricated at three final sintering temperatures (1100¬∞C, 1200¬∞C and 1300¬∞C). In all cases, grain boundaries are merged in addition to a visible reduction in the secondary phases which makes segmentation-based image analysis challenging. Through surface statistics (i.e. fractal dimension, autocorrelation length, texture aspect ratio and entropy) as a function of magnification we can quantify the electron microscopy image of the microstructure. We show that the plasma-microstructure interaction leads to an increase in autocorrelation length, texture aspect ratio and entropy for the optimum AZO ceramic sputtering target sintered at 1200¬∞C. Furthermore, a maximum reduction in fractal dimension span (as determined by exponential regression) is also observed for 1200¬∞C. In addition to the evaluation of plasma effects on sintering, our approach can provide a window towards understanding the underlying thin film growth mechanisms. We believe that this technique can be applied to the defect characterisation of a wide range of polycrystalline ceramic sputtering targets (e.g. ITO, CZTS, GAZO and so on) with the ultimate goal of improving the magnetron sputtering process and the resulting functional thin film. LAY DESCRIPTION: Magnetron sputtering allows scientists to make functional thin films on the order of the nanoscale. In this technique, atoms are plucked from a 'target' then placed onto a substrate forming a thin nanometric film: all thanks to magnets, a special power supply and the fourth state of matter (plasma). Understanding what is going on and how to make a 'good' thin film is important for making better light emitting diodes, solar cells and light sensors. Scientists use electron microscopy to see what is going on in the microstructure of the sputtered thin films to fine tune the sputtering recipe. Here, for the first time, we have applied electron microscopy to see the surface of the microstructure before and after magnetron sputtering. This will help us understanding the plasma-microstructure interaction allowing us to make more informed decisions when fine-tuning the sputtering process to get improved thin films. This is a case study of aluminium-doped zinc oxide (AZO) target that could potentially replace indium tin oxide (ITO), which is widely used as a transparent electrode in devices involving light and electricity. In this case, improved characteristics would be lower electrical resistivity and higher transmission of light. We show that it is possible to use a mathematical description (e.g. the fractal dimension) of the scanning electron microscopy picture to show a link between the target surface and the functional properties.

32931552,AFid: a tool for automated identification and exclusion of autofluorescent objects from microscopy images.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Autofluorescence is a long-standing problem that has hindered the analysis of images of tissues acquired by fluorescence microscopy. Current approaches to mitigate autofluorescence in tissue are lab-based and involve either chemical treatment of sections or specialized instrumentation and software to 'unmix' autofluorescent signals. Importantly, these approaches are pre-emptive and there are currently no methods to deal with autofluorescence in acquired fluorescence microscopy images.<h4>Results</h4>To address this, we developed Autofluorescence Identifier (AFid). AFid identifies autofluorescent pixels as discrete objects in multi-channel images post-acquisition. These objects can then be tagged for exclusion from downstream analysis. We validated AFid using images of FFPE human colorectal tissue stained for common immune markers. Further, we demonstrate its utility for image analysis where its implementation allows the accurate measurement of HIV-Dendritic cell interactions in a colorectal explant model of HIV transmission. Therefore, AFid represents a major leap forward in the extraction of useful data from images plagued by autofluorescence by offering an approach that is easily incorporated into existing workflows and that can be used with various samples, staining panels and image acquisition methods. We have implemented AFid in ImageJ, Matlab and R to accommodate the diverse image analysis community.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>AFid software is available at https://ellispatrick.github.io/AFid.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

32973479,Nutil: A Pre- and Post-processing Toolbox for Histological Rodent Brain Section Images.,"With recent technological advances in microscopy and image acquisition of tissue sections, further developments of tools are required for viewing, transforming, and analyzing the ever-increasing amounts of high-resolution data produced. In the field of neuroscience, histological images of whole rodent brain sections are commonly used for investigating brain connections as well as cellular and molecular organization in the normal and diseased brain, but present a problem for the typical neuroscientist with no or limited programming experience in terms of the pre- and post-processing steps needed for analysis. To meet this need we have designed <i>Nutil</i>, an open access and stand-alone executable software that enables automated transformations, post-processing, and analyses of 2D section images using multi-core processing (OpenMP). The software is written in C++ for efficiency, and provides the user with a clean and easy graphical user interface for specifying the input and output parameters. <i>Nutil</i> currently contains four separate tools: (1) A transformation toolchain named ""Transform"" that allows for rotation, mirroring and scaling, resizing, and renaming of very large tiled tiff images. (2) ""TiffCreator"" enables the generation of tiled TIFF images from other image formats such as PNG and JPEG. (3) A ""Resize"" tool completes the preprocessing toolset and allows downscaling of PNG and JPEG images with output in PNG format. (4) The fourth tool is a post-processing method called ""Quantifier"" that enables the quantification of segmented objects in the context of regions defined by brain atlas maps generated with the <i>QuickNII</i> software based on a 3D reference atlas (mouse or rat). The output consists of a set of report files, point cloud coordinate files for visualization in reference atlas space, and reference atlas images superimposed with color-coded objects.

32981359,Twenty-Four-Hour Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion and Their Associations With Blood Pressure Among Adults in China: Baseline Survey of Action on Salt China.,"This study aimed to assess current level of sodium and potassium intake and their associations with blood pressure (BP) using the 24-hour urinary data in a large sample of China. Data from participants aged 18 to 75 years were collected as the baseline survey of Action on Salt China in 2018. Of 5454 adults, 5353 completed 24-hour urine collection. The average sodium, potassium excretion, and sodium-to-potassium molar ratio were 4318.1¬±1814.1 mg/d (equivalent to 11.0¬±4.6 g/d of salt), 1573.7¬±627.1 mg/d, and 5.0¬±2.1, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounding factors and correcting for regression dilution, each 1000-mg increase in sodium excretion was associated with increased systolic BP (1.32 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, 0.92-1.81]) and diastolic BP (0.34 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, 0.09-0.60]). Each 1000-mg increase in potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic BP (-3.19 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, -4.38 to -2.20]) and diastolic BP (-1.56 mm‚ÄâHg [95% CI, -2.29 to -0.90]). Each unit increase in sodium-to-potassium molar ratio was associated with an increase of systolic BP by 1.21 mm‚ÄâHg (95% CI, 0.91-1.60) and diastolic BP by 0.44 mm‚ÄâHg (95% CI, 0.24-0.64). The relationships between sodium and BP mostly increase with the rise of BP quantiles. Potassium shows the opposite trend. The current sodium intake in Chinese adults remains high and potassium intake is low. Sodium and sodium-to-potassium ratio were positively associated with BP, whereas potassium was inversely associated with BP.

This database is an invaluable resource for researchers in the biological field, which classifies enzyme-related information in categories that are very useful to obtain specific functional and protein engineering information for enzyme families. However, the BRENDA web interface, the most used by researchers with a non-informatic background, does not allow the user to cross-reference data from different categories or sub-categories in the database. Obtaining information in an easy and fast way, in a friendly web interface, without the necessity to have a deep informatics knowledge, will facilitate and improve research in the enzymology and protein engineering field.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the Brenda Easy Search Tool (BEST), an interactive Shiny/R application that enables querying the BRENDA database for complex cross-tabulated characteristics, and retrieving enzyme-related parameters and information readily and efficiently, which can be used for the study of enzyme function or as an input for other bioinformatics tools.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>BEST and its tutorial are freely available from https://pesb2.cl/best/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,interface to another database,
33006570,Automating the Generation of Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Reports: Proof-of-Concept Study Involving Seven Hospitals in Seven Countries.,"<h4>Background</h4>Reporting cumulative antimicrobial susceptibility testing data on a regular basis is crucial to inform antimicrobial resistance (AMR) action plans at local, national, and global levels. However, analyzing data and generating a report are time consuming and often require trained personnel.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to develop and test an application that can support a local hospital to analyze routinely collected electronic data independently and generate AMR surveillance reports rapidly.<h4>Methods</h4>An offline application to generate standardized AMR surveillance reports from routinely available microbiology and hospital data files was written in the R programming language (R Project for Statistical Computing). The application can be run by double clicking on the application file without any further user input. The data analysis procedure and report content were developed based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (WHO GLASS). The application was tested on Microsoft Windows 10 and 7 using open access example data sets. We then independently tested the application in seven hospitals in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.<h4>Results</h4>We developed the AutoMated tool for Antimicrobial resistance Surveillance System (AMASS), which can support clinical microbiology laboratories to analyze their microbiology and hospital data files (in CSV or Excel format) onsite and promptly generate AMR surveillance reports (in PDF and CSV formats). The data files could be those exported from WHONET or other laboratory information systems. The automatically generated reports contain only summary data without patient identifiers. The AMASS application is downloadable from https://www.amass.website/. The participating hospitals tested the application and deposited their AMR surveillance reports in an open access data repository.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The AMASS is a useful tool to support the generation and sharing of AMR surveillance reports.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
33009809,Detection of mobile genetic elements associated with antibiotic resistance in Salmonella enterica using a newly developed web tool: MobileElementFinder.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinically relevant bacteria is a growing threat to public health globally. In these bacteria, antimicrobial resistance genes are often associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which promote their mobility, enabling them to rapidly spread throughout a bacterial community.<h4>Methods</h4>The tool MobileElementFinder was developed to enable rapid detection of MGEs and their genetic context in assembled sequence data. MGEs are detected based on sequence similarity to a database of 4452 known elements augmented with annotation of resistance genes, virulence factors and detection of plasmids.<h4>Results</h4>MobileElementFinder was applied to analyse the mobilome of 1725 sequenced Salmonella enterica isolates of animal origin from Denmark, Germany and the USA. We found that the MGEs were seemingly conserved according to multilocus ST and not restricted to either the host or the country of origin. Moreover, we identified putative translocatable units for specific aminoglycoside, sulphonamide and tetracycline genes. Several putative composite transposons were predicted that could mobilize, among others, AMR, metal resistance and phosphodiesterase genes associated with macrophage survivability. This is, to our knowledge, the first time the phosphodiesterase-like pdeL has been found to be potentially mobilized into S. enterica.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MobileElementFinder is a powerful tool to study the epidemiology of MGEs in a large number of genome sequences and to determine the potential for genomic plasticity of bacteria. This web service provides a convenient method of detecting MGEs in assembled sequence data.

33027504,PredHPI: an integrated web server platform for the detection and visualization of host-pathogen interactions using sequence-based methods.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Understanding the mechanisms underlying infectious diseases is fundamental to develop prevention strategies. Host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) are actively studied worldwide to find potential genomic targets for the development of novel drugs, vaccines and other therapeutics. Determining which proteins are involved in the interaction system behind an infectious process is the first step to develop an efficient disease control strategy. Very few computational methods have been implemented as web services to infer novel HPIs, and there is not a single framework which combines several of those approaches to produce and visualize a comprehensive analysis of HPIs.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we introduce PredHPI, a powerful framework that integrates both the detection and visualization of interaction networks in a single web service, facilitating the apprehension of model and non-model host-pathogen systems to aid the biologists in building hypotheses and designing appropriate experiments. PredHPI is built on high-performance computing resources on the backend capable of handling proteome-scale sequence data from both the host as well as pathogen. Data are displayed in an information-rich and interactive visualization, which can be further customized with user-defined layouts. We believe PredHPI will serve as an invaluable resource to diverse experimental biologists and will help advance the research in the understanding of complex infectious diseases.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PredHPI tool is freely available at http://bioinfo.usu.edu/PredHPI/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Sup plementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

The database can be created with either protein or nucleotide sequences containing all entries or complete genomes only. The pipeline can automatically clean the database by removing entries with matches to a database of user-specified sequence contaminants. The default contamination entries include sequences from the UniVec database of plasmids, marker genes and sequencing adapters from NCBI, an E.coli genome, rRNA sequences, vectors and satellite sequences. Furthermore, duplicates are removed and the database is automatically screened for sequences from green fluorescent protein, luciferase and antibiotic resistance genes that might be present in some GenBank viral entries, and could lead to false positives in virus identification. For utilizing the database, we present a useful opportunity for dealing with possible human contamination. We show the applicability of DONE by downloading a virus database comprising 37 virus families. We observed an average increase of 16 776 new entries downloaded per month for the 37 families. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of a custom database compared to a standard reference database for classifying both simulated and real sequence data.<h4>Availabilityand implementation</h4>The DONE pipeline for downloading and cleaning is deposited in a publicly available repository (https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/done/src/master/).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,interface to another database,for cleaning databases not a database itself
33039623,The Developmental Chronnecto-Genomics (Dev-CoG) study: A multimodal study on the developing brain.,"Brain development has largely been studied through unimodal analysis of neuroimaging data, providing independent results for structural and functional data. However, structure clearly impacts function and vice versa, pointing to the need for performing multimodal data collection and analysis to improve our understanding of brain development, and to further inform models of typical and atypical brain development across the lifespan. Ultimately, such models should also incorporate genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying brain structure and function, although currently this area is poorly specified. To this end, we are reporting here a multi-site, multi-modal dataset that captures cognitive function, brain structure and function, and genetic and epigenetic measures to better quantify the factors that influence brain development in children originally aged 9-14 years. Data collection for the Developmental Chronnecto-Genomics (Dev-CoG) study (http://devcog.mrn.org/) includes cognitive, emotional, and social performance scales, structural and functional MRI, diffusion MRI, magnetoencephalography (MEG), and saliva collection for DNA analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation patterns. Across two sites (The Mind Research Network and the University of Nebraska Medical Center), data from over 200 participants were collected and these children were re-tested annually for at least 3 years.

33054771,smORFunction: a tool for predicting functions of small open reading frames and microproteins.,"<h4>Background</h4>Small open reading frame (smORF) is open reading frame with a length of less than 100 codons. Microproteins, translated from smORFs, have been found to participate in a variety of biological processes such as muscle formation and contraction, cell proliferation, and immune activation. Although previous studies have collected and annotated a large abundance of smORFs, functions of the vast majority of smORFs are still unknown. It is thus increasingly important to develop computational methods to annotate the functions of these smORFs.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we collected 617,462 unique smORFs from three studies. The expression of smORF RNAs was estimated by reannotated microarray probes. Using a speed-optimized correlation algorism, the functions of smORFs were predicted by their correlated genes with known functional annotations. After applying our method to 5 known microproteins from literatures, our method successfully predicted their functions. Further validation from the UniProt database showed that at least one function of 202 out of 270 microproteins was predicted.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We developed a method, smORFunction, to provide function predictions of smORFs/microproteins in at most 265 models generated from 173 datasets, including 48 tissues/cells, 82 diseases (and normal).

Existing mNGS data analysis tools typically require bioinformatics expertise and access to local server-class hardware resources. For many research laboratories, this presents an obstacle, especially in resource-limited environments.<h4>Findings</h4>We present IDseq, an open source cloud-based metagenomics pipeline and service for global pathogen detection and monitoring (https://idseq.net). The IDseq Portal accepts raw mNGS data, performs host and quality filtration steps, then executes an assembly-based alignment pipeline, which results in the assignment of reads and contigs to taxonomic categories. The taxonomic relative abundances are reported and visualized in an easy-to-use web application to facilitate data interpretation and hypothesis generation. Furthermore, IDseq supports environmental background model generation and automatic internal spike-in control recognition, providing statistics that are critical for data interpretation. IDseq was designed with the specific intent of detecting novel pathogens. Here, we benchmark novel virus detection capability using both synthetically evolved viral sequences and real-world samples, including IDseq analysis of a nasopharyngeal swab sample acquired and processed locally in Cambodia from a tourist from Wuhan, China, infected with the recently emergent SARS-CoV-2.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The IDseq Portal reduces the barrier to entry for mNGS data analysis and enables bench scientists, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to gain insight from mNGS datasets for both known and novel pathogens.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

Consequently, searching for NQR spectral lines in previously uninvestigated materials represents a major challenge. Calculated EFGs can significantly aid at the search's inception. To facilitate this task, we have applied high-throughput density functional theory calculations to predict EFGs for 15187 materials in the JARVIS-DFT database. This database, which will include EFG as a standard entry, is continuously increasing. Given the large scope of the database, it is impractical to verify each calculation.

33110585,Rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Vietnam government's experience and preliminary success.,"<h4>Background</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic has hit all corners of the world, challenging governments to act promptly in controlling the spread of the pandemic. Due to limited resources and inferior technological capacities, developing countries including Vietnam have faced many challenges in combating the pandemic. Since the first cases were detected on 23 January 2020, Vietnam has undergone a 3-month fierce battle to control the outbreak with stringent measures from the government to mitigate the adverse impacts. In this study, we aim to give insights into the Vietnamese government's progress during the first three months of the outbreak. Additionally, we relatively compare Vietnam's response with that of other Southeast Asia countries to deliver a clear and comprehensive view on disease control strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>The data on the number of COVID-19 confirmed and recovered cases in Vietnam was obtained from the Dashboard for COVID-19 statistics of the Ministry of Health (https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn/). The review on Vietnam's country-level responses was conducted by searching for relevant government documents issued on the online database 'Vietnam Laws Repository' (https://thuvienphapluat.vn/en/index.aspx), with the grey literature on Google and relevant official websites. A stringency index of government policies and the countries' respective numbers of confirmed cases of nine Southeast Asian countries were adapted from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). All data was updated as of 24 April 2020.<h4>Results</h4>Preliminary positive results have been achieved given that the nation confirmed no new community-transmitted cases since 16 April and zero COVID-19 - related deaths throughout the 3-month pandemic period. To date, the pandemic has been successfully controlled thanks to the Vietnamese government's prompt, proactive and decisive responses including mobilization of the health care systems, security forces, economic policies, along with a creative and effective communication campaign corresponding with crucial milestones of the epidemic's progression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Vietnam could be one of the role models in pandemic control for low-resource settings. As the pandemic is still ongoing in an unpredictable trajectory, disease control measures should continue to be put in place in the foreseeable short term.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33116744,Identification of Novel Therapeutic Molecular Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease by Using Genetic Databases.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Utilization of genetic databases to identify genes involved in ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and their extra-intestinal manifestations.<h4>Methods</h4>Protein coding genes involved in ulcerative colitis (3783 genes), Crohn's disease (3980 genes), uveitis (1043 genes), arthritis (5583 genes), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (1313 genes), and pyoderma gangrenosum (119 genes) were categorized using four genetic databases. These include Genecards: The Human Gene Database (www.genecards.org), DisGeNET (https://www.disgenet.org/), The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (http://ctdbase.org/) and the Universal Protein Resource (https://www.uniprot.org/). NDex, Network Data Exchange (http://www.ndexbio.org/), was then utilized for mapping a unique signal pathway from the identified shared genes involved in the above disease processes.<h4>Results</h4>We have detected a unique array of 20 genes with the highest probability of overlay in UC, CD, uveitis, arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and PSC. Figure 1 represents the interactome of these 20 protein coding genes. Of note, unique immune modulators in different disease processes are also noted. Interleukin-25 (IL-25) and monensin-resistant homolog 2 (MON-2) are only noted in UC, CD, pyoderma gangrenosum, and arthritis. Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) is involved in UC, CD, and arthritis. SLCO1B3 is exclusively involved with pyoderma gangrenosum, UC, and CD. As expected, TNF involvement is noted in CD, UC, PSC, and arthritis. Table 1 depicts the detailed result.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our work has identified a distinctive set of genes involved in IBD and its associated extra-intestinal disease processes. These genes play crucial roles in mechanisms of immune response, inflammation, and apoptosis and further our understanding of this complex disease process. We postulate that these genes play a critical role at intersecting pathways involved in inflammatory bowel disease, and these novel molecules, their upstream and downstream effectors, are potential targets for future therapeutic agents.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,references other db,not descriptive of resource
33135733,Maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral networks by integer linear programming.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The study of the evolutionary history of biological networks enables deep functional understanding of various bio-molecular processes. Network growth models, such as the Duplication-Mutation with Complementarity (DMC) model, provide a principled approach to characterizing the evolution of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on duplication and divergence. Current methods for model-based ancestral network reconstruction primarily use greedy heuristics and yield sub-optimal solutions.<h4>Results</h4>We present a new Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solution for maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral PPI networks using the DMC model. We prove the correctness of our solution that is designed to find the optimal solution. It can also use efficient heuristics from general-purpose ILP solvers to obtain multiple optimal and near-optimal solutions that may be useful in many applications. Experiments on synthetic data show that our ILP obtains solutions with higher likelihood than those from previous methods, and is robust to noise and model mismatch. We evaluate our algorithm on two real PPI networks, with proteins from the families of bZIP transcription factors and the Commander complex. On both the networks, solutions from our ILP have higher likelihood and are in better agreement with independent biological evidence from other studies.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A Python implementation is available at https://bitbucket.org/cdal/network-reconstruction.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

It is important to avoid false positive enrichment due to sequence biases in the genome, such as GC-bias. Therefore, relying on an appropriate set of background sequences is crucial for enrichment analysis.<h4>Results</h4>We developed BiasAway, a command line tool and its dedicated easy-to-use web server to generate synthetic sequences matching any k-mer nucleotide composition or select genomic DNA sequences matching the mononucleotide composition of the foreground sequences through four different models. For genomic sequences, we provide precomputed partitions of genomes from nine species with five different bin sizes to generate appropriate genomic background sequences.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>BiasAway source code is freely available from Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/CBGR/biasaway) and can be easily installed using bioconda or pip.

33164522,Comprehensive Study on Molecular Supervised Learning with Graph Neural Networks.,"This work considers strategies to develop accurate and reliable graph neural networks (GNNs) for molecular property predictions. Prediction performance of GNNs is highly sensitive to the change in various parameters due to the inherent challenges in molecular machine learning, such as a deficient amount of data samples and bias in data distribution. Comparative studies with well-designed experiments are thus important to clearly understand which GNNs are powerful for molecular supervised learning. Our work presents a number of ablation studies along with a guideline to train and utilize GNNs for both molecular regression and classification tasks. First, we validate that using both atomic and bond meta-information improves the prediction performance in the regression task. Second, we find that the graph isomorphism hypothesis proposed by [Xu, K.<i>; et al</i> How powerful are graph neural networks? 2018, arXiv:1810.00826. arXiv.org e-Print archive. https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826] is valid for the regression task. Surprisingly, however, the findings above do not hold for the classification tasks. Beyond the study on model architectures, we test various regularization methods and Bayesian learning algorithms to find the best strategy to achieve a reliable classification system. We demonstrate that regularization methods penalizing predictive entropy might not give well-calibrated probability estimation, even though they work well in other domains, and Bayesian learning methods are capable of developing reliable prediction systems. Furthermore, we argue the importance of Bayesian learning in virtual screening by showing that well-calibrated probability estimation may lead to a higher success rate.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33185649,"A system-level analysis of patient disease trajectories based on clinical, phenotypic and molecular similarities.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Incorporating the temporal dimension into multimorbidity studies has shown to be crucial for achieving a better understanding of the disease associations. Furthermore, due to the multifactorial nature of human disease, exploring disease associations from different perspectives can provide a holistic view to support the study of their aetiology.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, a temporal systems-medicine approach is proposed for identifying time-dependent multimorbidity patterns from patient disease trajectories, by integrating data from electronic health records with genetic and phenotypic information. Specifically, the disease trajectories are clustered using an unsupervised algorithm based on dynamic time warping and three disease similarity metrics: clinical, genetic and phenotypic. An evaluation method is also presented for quantitatively assessing, in the different disease spaces, both the cluster homogeneity and the respective similarities between the associated diseases within individual trajectories. The latter can facilitate exploring the origin(s) in the identified disease patterns. The proposed integrative methodology can be applied to any longitudinal cohort and disease of interest. In this article, prostate cancer is selected as a use case of medical interest to demonstrate, for the first time, the identification of temporal disease multimorbidities in different disease spaces.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://gitlab.com/agiannoula/diseasetrajectories.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors, clinical outcomes and predictors of stroke mortality at a tertiary hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study was conducted on stroke patients admitted at the Connaught Teaching Hospital between 1st January to December 31, 2018. Clinical data related to stroke, with variables including patients' demographics, stroke subtype, vascular risk factors, modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and outcomes were documented. In-hospital mortality, associated risk factors and predictors of stroke were determined. The study was approved by the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee. It was registered under Research Registry https://www.researchregistry.com/browse-the-registry#home/with the unique identifying number researchregistry6009.<h4>Result</h4>We studied 178 (95 male and 83 female) patients. The mean age was 59.8 ¬± 14.0 years, median was 58.1years (ranging: 29-88 years). The commonest risk factors were hypertension (84.3%), tobacco smoking (35.9%) and alcohol (31.4%). Ischemic stroke confirmed by CT scan was 76.3%. In-hospital mortality was 34.8% and at discharge, mean modified Rankin Score (mRS) was 3.89 ¬± 1.62. The independent predictors for stroke mortality were: hypertension [AOR = 2.2; C.I 95%: (1.32-3.80), p = 0.001], previous stroke [AOR = 2.31; C.I 95%: (1.43-5.74), p = 0.001], GCS < 8 [AOR = 6.06; C.I 95%: (3.17-12.79), p < 0.001], clinical diagnosis in the absence of imaging [AOR = 3.11; C.I 95%: (2.1-9.87), p = 0.001], hemorrhagic stroke [AOR = 2.96; C.I 95%: (1.96-9.54), p < 0.001], and aspiration pneumonia [(AOR = 3.03; C.I 95%:(1.44-6.36), p = 0.001]. Women had poorer outcome than men.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This study highlights a high stroke mortality in a resource limited hospital, with some stroke patients having difficulties in accessing Computer Tomogram (CT) scan services.

33212503,DeepBL: a deep learning-based approach for in silico discovery of beta-lactamases.,"Beta-lactamases (BLs) are enzymes localized in the periplasmic space of bacterial pathogens, where they confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Experimental identification of BLs is costly yet crucial to understand beta-lactam resistance mechanisms. To address this issue, we present DeepBL, a deep learning-based approach by incorporating sequence-derived features to enable high-throughput prediction of BLs. Specifically, DeepBL is implemented based on the Small VGGNet architecture and the TensorFlow deep learning library. Furthermore, the performance of DeepBL models is investigated in relation to the sequence redundancy level and negative sample selection in the benchmark dataset. The models are trained on datasets of varying sequence redundancy thresholds, and the model performance is evaluated by extensive benchmarking tests.

33222322,Analysis of mutational signatures with yet another package for signature analysis.,"Different mutational processes leave characteristic patterns of somatic mutations in the genome that can be identified as mutational signatures. Determining the contributions of mutational signatures to cancer genomes allows not only to reconstruct the etiology of somatic mutations, but can also be used for improved tumor classification and support therapeutic decisions. We here present the R package yet another package for signature analysis (YAPSA) to deconvolute the contributions of mutational signatures to tumor genomes. YAPSA provides in-built collections from the COSMIC and PCAWG SNV signature sets as well as the PCAWG Indel signatures and employs signature-specific cutoffs to increase sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, YAPSA allows to determine 95% confidence intervals for signature exposures, to perform constrained stratified signature analyses to obtain enrichment and depletion patterns of the identified signatures and, when applied to whole exome sequencing data, to correct for the triplet content of individual target capture kits. With this functionality, YAPSA has proved to be a valuable tool for analysis of mutational signatures in molecular tumor boards in a precision oncology context.

33272133,Incidence and Outcome of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: The Swiss Study on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (Swiss SOS).,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>The purpose of this study was to assess nationwide incidence and outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The Swiss SOS (Swiss Study on Subarachnoid Hemorrhage) was established in 2008 and offers the unique opportunity to provide this data from the point of care on a nationwide level.<h4>Methods</h4>All patients with confirmed aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage admitted between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014, within Switzerland were recorded in a prospective registry. Incidence rates were calculated based on time-matched population data. Admission parameters and outcomes at discharge and at 1 year were recorded.<h4>Results</h4>We recorded data of 1787 consecutive patients. The incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland was 3.7 per 100 000 persons/y. The number of female patients was 1170 (65.5%). With a follow-up rate of 91.3% at 1 year, 1042 patients (58.8%) led an independent life according to the modified Rankin Scale (0-2). About 1 in 10 patients survived in a dependent state (modified Rankin Scale, 3-5; n=185; 10.4%). Case fatality was 20.1% (n=356) at discharge and 22.1% (n=391) after 1 year.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The current incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in Switzerland is lower than expected and an indication of a global trend toward decreasing admissions for ruptured intracranial aneurysms.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of diet with RCC's incidence and mortality rates worldwide. We conducted an ecological study including 170 countries, whose data on age-standardized (AS) incidence and mortality rates of RCC, dietary factors, and potentially confounding factors such as obesity, insufficient physical activity, tobacco smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and human development index (HDI) were collected and available on May 2020 from the Global Cancer Observatory, the Global Dietary Database, the Global Health Observatory data repository, the Diabetes Atlas 9th edition and the Human Development Report 2019. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to determine the association of dietary factors with incidence and mortality rates of RCC adjusted for the effects of population age and potentially confounding factors. Intake of processed meats and consumption of alcohol were both positively associated with AS incidence rates of RCC (Œ≤ = 0.11, <i>P</i>‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001 and Œ≤ = 0.1, <i>P</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.044, respectively). We suggest that high consumption of processed meats and/or alcohol is a risk factor for RCC. However, they were not associated with mortality.

Patients with stroke with a time last-known-well >4.5 hours who showed a mismatch between diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive alteplase at 0.6 mg/kg intravenously or standard medical treatment. The patients were dichotomized by ischemic core size or National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and the effects of assigned treatments were compared in each group. The efficacy outcome was favorable outcome at 90 days, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1.<h4>Results</h4>The median DWI-Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) was 9, and the median ischemic core volume was 2.5 mL. Both favorable outcome (47.1% versus 48.3%) and any intracranial hemorrhage (26% versus 14%) at 22 to 36 hours were comparable between the 68 thrombolyzed patients and the 58 control patients. There was a significant treatment-by-cohort interaction for favorable outcome between dichotomized patients by ASPECTS on DWI (<i>P</i>=0.026) and core volume (<i>P</i>=0.035). Favorable outcome was more common in the alteplase group than in the control group in patients with DWI-ASPECTS 5 to 8 (RR, 4.75 [95% CI, 1.33-30.2]), although not in patients with DWI-ASPECTS 9 to 10. Favorable outcome tended to be more common in the alteplase group than in the control group in patients with core volume >6.4 mL (RR, 6.15 [95% CI, 0.87-43.64]), although not in patients with volume ‚â§6.4 mL. The frequency of any intracranial hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment groups in any dichotomized patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients developing unknown onset stroke with DWI-ASPECTS 5 to 8 showed favorable outcomes more commonly after low-dose thrombolysis than after standard treatment.

Undernutrition is a significant challenge among older adults and is associated with poorer health experiences. Digital health for self-monitoring of diet has the potential to increase awareness of personal nutrition, and the scarcity of research reporting older adults' ability and willingness to engage in technology-mediated dietary self-monitoring warranted this study.<h4>Design and methods</h4>An explorative mixed-methods design combining descriptive analysis of log data with qualitative analysis of interviews with Appetitus users was implemented.<h4>Findings</h4>Twenty-five older adults self-monitored their diet using Appetitus over an 8-week trial period. Eighty percent of the participants used the app regularly in the trial period. The most engaged users recorded their food consumption daily for 8 weeks. Personal interest in nutrition and commitment to the project facilitated regular use of Appetitus. Poor health and the perception that using a nutrition app lacked personal relevance contributed to irregular self-monitoring. For inexperienced technology users, participation in this project became a springboard to using tablet technology and the Internet beyond the Appetitus app.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The majority of the participants regularly used Appetitus for self-monitoring of diet; they found the tablet technology and Appetitus app easy to use.<h4>Clinical relevance</h4>Older adults are able and willing to use self-monitoring tools. Nutrition apps can empower older adults to make better informed decisions about their diet.

33342295,Markedness and implicational relationships in phonological development: A cross-linguistic investigation.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The complexity approach to speech disorders, based on the theoretical notion of phonological markedness, has been gaining interest over the last decade. In a nutshell, this approach suggests that the acquisition of phonologically marked units (e.g. complex onsets) implies the acquisition of less marked ones (e.g. singleton onsets). However, because the notion of markedness is, itself, subject to controversies, we need to constrain what types of implications can be generalised among language learners, within and across languages.<h4>Method</h4>We report on longitudinal data from one phonologically-disordered and five typically-developing children documented across four different languages (English, French, German, Portuguese), using data from the PhonBank database (https://phonbank.talkbank.org). Using the Phon software program (https://www.phon.ca), we systematically analysed each longitudinal study for consonants in singleton onsets and codas as well as in onset clusters.<h4>Result</h4>The implicational relationships supported by our study involve units of similar types (e.g. relations between different segmental categories), while relationships that involve different types of units or processes cannot be generalised across learners.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A better understanding of implicational relationships makes the complexity approach more predictive of developmental patterns of phonology and related phonological disorders.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,mentions database,not life sci

However, native proteins cannot usually withstand the harsh industrial environment, since they are evolved to function under mild conditions. Ancestral sequence reconstruction is a well-established method for deducing the evolutionary history of genes. Besides its applicability to discover the most probable evolutionary ancestors of the modern proteins, ancestral sequence reconstruction has proven to be a useful approach for the design of highly stable proteins.

33348264,Combining in vivo pathohistological and redox status analysis with in silico toxicogenomic study to explore the phthalates and bisphenol A mixture-induced testicular toxicity.,"The aim of this study was to: (i) determine and compare the capacity of bis (2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), bisphenol A (BPA), and their mixture to produce testicular toxicity after the subacute exposure; (ii) explore the mechanisms behind the observed changes using in silico toxicogenomic approach. Male rats were randomly split into groups (n = 6): (1) Control (corn oil); (2) DEHP (50 mg/kg b.w./day); (3) DBP (50 mg/kg b.w./day); (4) BPA (25 mg/kg b.w./day); and (5) MIX (50 mg/kg b.w./day DEHP + 50 mg/kg b.w/day DBP + 25 mg/kg b.w./day BPA). Animals were sacrificed after 28 days of oral exposure, testes were extracted and prepared for histological assessments under the light microscope (haematoxylin and eosin staining) and redox status analysis. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://CTD.mdibl.org), Cytoscape software (https://cytoscape.org) and ToppGene Suite (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) were used for data-mining. Present pathohistological study has demonstrated more pronounced testicular toxicity of the MIX group (desquamated germinal epithelium cells, enlarged cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, multinucleated cell forms and intracytoplasmic vacuoles) in comparison with the single substances, while effects on redox status parameters were either more prominent, or present only in the MIX group. In silico investigation revealed 20 genes linked to male reproductive disorders, affected by all three investigated substances. Effects on metabolism, AhR pathway, apoptosis and oxidative stress could be singled out as the most probable mechanisms involved in the subacute DEHP, DBP and BPA mixture testicular toxicity, while the effect on oxidative stress parameters was confirmed by in vivo experiment.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not descriptive of resource
33354878,Industry payments to hospitalist physicians: a 5-year analysis of the Open Payments programme from 2014 to 2018.,We analysed Open Payments programme data (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov) on industry-to-physician payments to hospitalists for the years 2014 to 2018. Payments to hospitalists increased by 106.5% from 2014 to 2018 with food and beverage (38.5%) and compensation for services other than consulting (24.3%) being the highest-paid categories. Industry payment to hospitalists was highly skewed with top 10 hospitalists receiving more than 30% of the total payments during the study period. The most common drugs associated with payments were anticoagulant medications (apixaban and rivaroxaban). Industry seems to be spending a significant amount of money to increase awareness of medications among hospitalists. Identification of these trends and potential motives of industry spending is critical to address any potential physician bias.,"hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not life sci
33361083,Development and external validation of a COVID-19 mortality risk prediction algorithm: a multicentre retrospective cohort study.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to develop and externally validate a COVID-19 mortality risk prediction algorithm.<h4>Design</h4>Retrospective cohort study.<h4>Setting</h4>Five designated tertiary hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China.<h4>Participants</h4>We routinely collected medical data of 1364 confirmed adult patients with COVID-19 between 8 January and 19 March 2020. Among them, 1088 patients from two designated hospitals in Wuhan were used to develop the prognostic model, and 276 patients from three hospitals outside Wuhan were used for external validation. All patients were followed up for a maximal of 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19.<h4>Methods</h4>The model discrimination was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Somers' D test, and calibration was examined by the calibration plot. Decision curve analysis was conducted.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 60 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19.<h4>Results</h4>The full model included seven predictors of age, respiratory failure, white cell count, lymphocytes, platelets, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase. The simple model contained five indicators of age, respiratory failure, coronary heart disease, renal failure and heart failure. After cross-validation, the AUC statistics based on derivation cohort were 0.96 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.97) for the full model and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89 to 0.95) for the simple model. The AUC statistics based on the external validation cohort were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98) for the full model and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.96) for the simple model. Good calibration accuracy of these two models was found in the derivation and validation cohort.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prediction models showed good model performance in identifying patients with COVID-19 with a high risk of death in 60 days. It may be useful for acute risk classification.<h4>Web calculator</h4>We provided a freely accessible web calculator (https://www.whuyijia.com/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33362409,Bayesian differential programming for robust systems identification under uncertainty.,"This paper presents a machine learning framework for Bayesian systems identification from noisy, sparse and irregular observations of nonlinear dynamical systems. The proposed method takes advantage of recent developments in differentiable programming to propagate gradient information through ordinary differential equation solvers and perform Bayesian inference with respect to unknown model parameters using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. This allows an efficient inference of the posterior distributions over plausible models with quantified uncertainty, while the use of sparsity-promoting priors enables the discovery of interpretable and parsimonious representations for the underlying latent dynamics. A series of numerical studies is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, including nonlinear oscillators, predator-prey systems and examples from systems biology. Taken together, our findings put forth a flexible and robust workflow for data-driven model discovery under uncertainty.

Given that only a tip of iceberg of drugs was founded in nearly one-century's experimental exploration, it shows great significance to use in silico methods to expand chemical database and profile drug-target linkages. In this study, a web server named ChemGenerator was proposed to generate novel activates for specific targets based on users' input. The ChemGenerator relies on an autoencoder-based algorithm of Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short-Term Memory by training of 7 million of molecular Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System as the basic model, and further develops target guided generation by transfer learning. As results, ChemGenerator gains lower loss (<0.01) than existing reference model (0.2~0.4) and shows good performance in the case of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. Meanwhile, ChemGenerator is now freely accessible to the public by http://smiles.tcmobile.org.

Experimental efforts to increase solubility are plagued by low success rates and often reduce biological activity. Computational prediction of protein expressibility and solubility in Escherichia coli using only sequence information could reduce the cost of experimental studies by enabling prioritisation of highly soluble proteins.<h4>Results</h4>A new tool for sequence-based prediction of soluble protein expression in Escherichia coli, SoluProt, was created using the gradient boosting machine technique with the TargetTrack database as a training set. When evaluated against a balanced independent test set derived from the NESG database, SoluProt's accuracy of 58.5% and AUC of 0.62 exceeded those of a suite of alternative solubility prediction tools.

33441366,Protocol for a qualitative study to identify strategies to optimise hospital ePrescribing systems.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) is a key area of development and investment in the UK and across the developed world. ePrescribing is widely understood as a vehicle for tackling medication-related safety concerns, improving care quality and making more efficient use of health resources. Nevertheless, implementation of an electronic health record does not itself ensure benefits for prescribing are maximised. We examine the process of optimisation of ePrescribing systems using case studies to provide policy recommendations based on the experiences of digitally mature hospital sites.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>Qualitative interviews within six digitally mature sites will be carried out. The aim is to capture successful optimisation of electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) in particular health systems and hospitals. We have identified hospital sites in the UK and in three other developed countries. We used a combination of literature reviews and advice from experts at Optimising ePrescribing in Hospitals (eP Opt) Project round-table events. Sites were purposively selected based on geographical area, innovative work in ePrescribing/electronic health (eHealth) and potential transferability of practices to the UK setting. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed and transcripts coded thematically using NVivo software. Relevant policy and governance documents will be analysed, where available. Planned site visits were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The Usher Research Ethics Group granted approval for this study. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals in medical informatics and expert round-table events, lay member meetings and the ePrescribing Toolkit (http://www.eprescribingtoolkit.com/)-an online resource supporting National Health Service (NHS) hospitals through the ePrescribing process.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Data-informed decision-making strategies to identify individuals at high risk of dementia are essential to facilitate large-scale prevention and early intervention. This population-based case-control study aims to develop and validate a clinical algorithm for predicting dementia diagnosis, based on the cognitive footprint in personal and medical history.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>We will use territory-wide electronic health records from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System (CDARS) in Hong Kong between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2018. All individuals who were at least 65 years old by the end of 2018 will be identified from CDARS. A random sample of control individuals who did not receive any diagnosis of dementia will be matched with those who <i>did</i> receive such a diagnosis by age, gender and index date with 1:1 ratio. Exposure to potential protective/risk factors will be included in both conventional logistic regression and machine-learning models. Established risk factors of interest will include diabetes mellitus, midlife hypertension, midlife obesity, depression, head injuries and low education. Exploratory risk factors will include vascular disease, infectious disease and medication. The prediction accuracy of several state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms will be compared.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>This study was approved by Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (UW 18-225).

Core variables to be collected into the APEX COPD registry were agreed on by Delphi consensus and fall into 3 domains: demographics, COPD monitoring, and treatment. Main strengths of the registry include: 1) its size and scope (in terms of patient numbers, geographic spread and use of multiple information sources including patient-reported information); 2) collection of variables which are clinically relevant and practical to collect within primary care; 3) use of electronic data capture systems to ensure high-quality data and minimization of data-entry requirements; 4) inclusion of clinical, database development, management and communication experts; 5) regular sharing of key findings, both at international/national congresses and in peer-reviewed publications; and 6) a robust organizational structure to ensure continuance of the registry, and that research outputs are ethical, relevant and continue to bring value to both patients and physicians.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,Chuck Check - med records out of scope
33459772,SubtypeDrug: a software package for prioritization of candidate cancer subtype-specific drugs.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Cancer can be classified into various subtypes by its molecular, histological, or clinical characteristics. Discovering cancer-subtype-specific drugs is a crucial step in personalized medicine. SubtypeDrug is a system biology R-based software package that enables the prioritization of subtype-specific drugs based on cancer expression data from samples of many subtypes. This provides a novel approach to identify the subtype-specific drug by considering biological functions regulated by drugs at the subpathway level. The operation modes include extraction of subpathways from biological pathways, identification of dysregulated subpathways induced by each drug, inference of sample-specific subpathway activity profiles, evaluation of drug-disease reverse association at the subpathways level, identification of cancer-subtype-specific drugs through subtype sample set enrichment analysis, and visualization of the results. Its capabilities enable SubtypeDrug to find subtype-specific drugs, which will fill the gaps in the recent tools which only identify the drugs for a particular cancer type. SubtypeDrug may help to facilitate the development of tailored treatment for patients with cancer.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The package is implemented in R and available under GPL-2 license from the CRAN website (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SubtypeDrug).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

Understanding these processes at a molecular level requires knowledge of their three-dimensional structures. Experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cryogenic electron microscopy can resolve protein structures but are costly and time-consuming and do not work for all proteins. Computational protein structure prediction tries to overcome these problems by predicting the structure of a new protein using existing protein structures as a resource. Here we present TopSuite, a web server for protein model quality assessment (TopScore) and template-based protein structure prediction (TopModel). TopScore provides meta-predictions for global and residue-wise model quality estimation using deep neural networks.

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR¬Æ) standard which is overcoming the interoperability problems in health information exchange was extended to evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge with the EBMonFHIR project. A 13-step Code System Development Protocol was created in September 2020 to support global development of terminologies for exchange of scientific evidence. For Step 1, we assembled expert working groups with 55 people from 26 countries by October 2020. For Step 2, we identified 23 commonly used tools and systems for which the first version of code systems will be developed. For Step 3, a total of 368 non-redundant concepts were drafted to become display terms for four code systems (Statistic Type, Statistic Model, Study Design, Risk of Bias). Steps 4 through 13 will guide ongoing development and maintenance of these terminologies for scientific exchange. When completed, the code systems will facilitate identifying, processing, and reporting research results and the reliability of those results. More efficient and detailed scientific communication will reduce cost and burden and improve health outcomes, quality of life, and patient, caregiver, and healthcare professional satisfaction.

33529731,Deep learning for the radiographic diagnosis of proximal femur fractures: Limitations and programming issues.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Radiology is one of the domains where artificial intelligence (AI) yields encouraging results, with diagnostic accuracy that approaches that of experienced radiologists and physicians. Diagnostic errors in traumatology are rare but can have serious functional consequences. Using AI as a radiological diagnostic aid may be beneficial in the emergency room. Thus, an effective, low-cost software that helps with making radiographic diagnoses would be a relevant tool for current clinical practice, although this concept has rarely been evaluated in orthopedics for proximal femur fractures (PFF). This led us to conduct a prospective study with the goals of: 1) programming deep learning software to help make the diagnosis of PFF on radiographs and 2) to evaluate its performance.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>It is possible to program an effective deep learning software to help make the diagnosis of PFF based on a limited number of radiographs.<h4>Methods</h4>Our database consisted of 1309 radiographs: 963 had a PFF, while 346 did not. The sample size was increased 8-fold (resulting in 10,472 radiographs) using a validated technique. Each radiograph was evaluated by an orthopedic surgeon using RectLabel‚Ñ¢ software (https://rectlabel.com), by differentiating between healthy and fractured zones. Fractures were classified according to the AO system. The deep learning algorithm was programmed on Tensorflow‚Ñ¢ software (Google Brain, Santa Clara, Ca, USA, tensorflow.org). In all, 9425 annotated radiographs (90%) were used for the training phase and 1074 (10%) for the test phase.<h4>Results</h4>The sensitivity of the algorithm was 61% for femoral neck fractures and 67% for trochanteric fractures. The specificity was 67% and 69%, the positive predictive value was 55% and 56%, while the negative predictive value was 74% and 78%, respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our results are not good enough for our algorithm to be used in current clinical practice. Programming of deep learning software with sufficient diagnostic accuracy can only be done with several tens of thousands of radiographs, or by using transfer learning.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>III; Diagnostic studies, Study of nonconsecutive patients, without consistently applied reference ""gold"" standard.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

To extract useful information there is the need to extract spatial and temporal data on the particles that are in the images, but particle tracking and feature extraction need some kind of assistance.<h4>Results</h4>This manuscript introduces our new freely downloadable toolbox, the Visual4DTracker. It is a MATLAB package implementing several useful functionalities to navigate, analyse and proof-read the track of each particle detected in any [Formula: see text] stack. Furthermore, it allows users to proof-read and to evaluate the traces with respect to a given gold standard. The Visual4DTracker toolbox permits the users to visualize and save all the generated results through a user-friendly graphical user interface. This tool has been successfully used in three applicative examples. The first processes synthetic data to show all the software functionalities. The second shows how to process a 4D image stack showing the time-lapse growth of Drosophila cells in an embryo. The third example presents the quantitative analysis of insulin granules in living beta-cells, showing that such particles have two main dynamics that coexist inside the cells.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Visual4DTracker is a software package for MATLAB to visualize, handle and manually track [Formula: see text] stacks of microscopy images containing objects such cells, granules, etc..

33563213,lncEvo: automated identification and conservation study of long noncoding RNAs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Long noncoding RNAs represent a large class of transcripts with two common features: they exceed an arbitrary length threshold of 200 nt and are assumed to not encode proteins. Although a growing body of evidence indicates that the vast majority of lncRNAs are potentially nonfunctional, hundreds of them have already been revealed to perform essential gene regulatory functions or to be linked to a number of cellular processes, including those associated with the etiology of human diseases. To better understand the biology of lncRNAs, it is essential to perform a more in-depth study of their evolution. In contrast to protein-encoding transcripts, however, they do not show the strong sequence conservation that usually results from purifying selection; therefore, software that is typically used to resolve the evolutionary relationships of protein-encoding genes and transcripts is not applicable to the study of lncRNAs.<h4>Results</h4>To tackle this issue, we developed lncEvo, a computational pipeline that consists of three modules: (1) transcriptome assembly from RNA-Seq data, (2) prediction of lncRNAs, and (3) conservation study-a genome-wide comparison of lncRNA transcriptomes between two species of interest, including search for orthologs. Importantly, one can choose to apply lncEvo solely for transcriptome assembly or lncRNA prediction, without calling the conservation-related part.<h4>Conclusions</h4>lncEvo is an all-in-one tool built with the Nextflow framework, utilizing state-of-the-art software and algorithms with customizable trade-offs between speed and sensitivity, ease of use and built-in reporting functionalities.

33579190,A graph-based algorithm for detecting rigid domains in protein structures.,"<h4>Background</h4>Conformational transitions are implicated in the biological function of many proteins. Structural changes in proteins can be described approximately as the relative movement of rigid domains against each other. Despite previous efforts, there is a need to develop new domain segmentation algorithms that are capable of analysing the entire structure database efficiently and do not require the choice of protein-dependent tuning parameters such as the number of rigid domains.<h4>Results</h4>We develop a graph-based method for detecting rigid domains in proteins. Structural information from multiple conformational states is represented by a graph whose nodes correspond to amino acids. Graph clustering algorithms allow us to reduce the graph and run the Viterbi algorithm on the associated line graph to obtain a segmentation of the input structures into rigid domains. In contrast to many alternative methods, our approach does not require knowledge about the number of rigid domains. Moreover, we identified default values for the algorithmic parameters that are suitable for a large number of conformational ensembles. We test our algorithm on examples from the DynDom database and illustrate our method on various challenging systems whose structural transitions have been studied extensively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results strongly suggest that our graph-based algorithm forms a novel framework to characterize structural transitions in proteins via detecting their rigid domains.

All classifiers were subjected to the training, 10-fold cross-validation, and testing on an independent dataset. The results of this study showed that the quadratic discriminant classifier presented the best performance measures over the independent dataset, accuracy = 0.7384, AUC = 0.817, recall = 0.676, precision = 0.7857, F1 = 0.713, kappa = 0.4764, and Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.4834, outperforming common machine learning classifiers used in the bioinformatics area. We believe that our prediction model could be of great importance in the field of cancer immunotherapy for the search of potential tumor antigens. Taking all aspects mentioned before, we developed an immunoinformatic tool called TAP 1.0 with a friendly interface for tumor antigens prediction, available at https://tapredictor.herokuapp.com/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,extracted data - used for methods
33593821,Therapeutic Targeting of DGKA-Mediated Macropinocytosis Leads to Phospholipid Reprogramming in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare destructive lung disease affecting primarily women and is the primary lung manifestation of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In lymphangioleiomyomatosis, biallelic loss of TSC1/2 leads to hyperactivation of mTORC1 and inhibition of autophagy. To determine how the metabolic vulnerabilities of TSC2-deficient cells can be targeted, we performed a high-throughput screen utilizing the ""Repurposing"" library at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard (Cambridge, MA), with or without the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine. Ritanserin, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKA), was identified as a selective inhibitor of proliferation of Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), with no impact on Tsc2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs. DGKA is a lipid kinase that metabolizes diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid, a key component of plasma membranes. Phosphatidic acid levels were increased 5-fold in Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs compared with Tsc2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs, and treatment of Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs with ritanserin led to depletion of phosphatidic acid as well as rewiring of phospholipid metabolism. Macropinocytosis is known to be upregulated in TSC2-deficient cells. Ritanserin decreased macropinocytic uptake of albumin, limited the number of lysosomes, and reduced lysosomal activity in Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. In a mouse model of TSC, ritanserin treatment decreased cyst frequency and volume, and in a mouse model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, genetic downregulation of DGKA prevented alveolar destruction and airspace enlargement. Collectively, these data indicate that DGKA supports macropinocytosis in TSC2-deficient cells to maintain phospholipid homeostasis and promote proliferation. Targeting macropinocytosis with ritanserin may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of TSC and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identifies macropinocytosis and phospholipid metabolism as novel mechanisms of metabolic homeostasis in mTORC1-hyperactive cells and suggest ritanserin as a novel therapeutic strategy for use in mTORC1-hyperactive tumors, including pancreatic cancer.

33634706,Autonomic Alterations After Pulmonary Vein Isolation in the CIRCA-DOSE (Cryoballoon vs Irrigated Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation) Study.,"Background The natural history of autonomic alterations following catheter ablation of drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is poorly defined, largely because of the historical reliance on non-invasive intermittent rhythm monitoring for outcome ascertainment. Methods and Results The study included 346 patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing pulmonary vein isolation using contemporary advanced-generation ablation technologies. All patients underwent insertion of a Reveal LINQ (Medtronic) implantable cardiac monitor before ablation. The implantable cardiac monitor continuously recorded physical activity, heart rate variability (measured as the SD of the average normal-to-normal), daytime heart rate, and nighttime heart rate. Longitudinal autonomic data in the 2-month period leading up to the date of ablation were compared with the period from 91 to 365 days following ablation. Following ablation there was a significant decrease in SD of the average normal-to-normal (mean difference versus baseline of 19.3 ms; range, 12.9-25.7; <i>P</i><0.0001), and significant increases in daytime and nighttime heart rates (mean difference versus baseline of 9.6 bpm; range, 7.4-11.8; <i>P</i><0.0001, and 7.4 bpm; range, 5.4-9.3; <i>P</i><0.0001, respectively). Patients free of arrhythmia recurrence had significantly faster daytime (11¬±11 versus 8¬±12 bpm, <i>P</i>=0.001) and nighttime heart rates (8¬±9 versus 6¬±8 bpm, <i>P</i>=0.049), but no difference in SD of the average normal-to-normal (<i>P</i>=0.09) compared with those with atrial fibrillation recurrence. Ablation technology and cryoablation duration did not influence these autonomic nervous system effects. Conclusions Pulmonary vein isolation results in significant sustained changes in the heart rate parameters related to autonomic function. These changes are correlated with procedural outcome and are independent of the ablation technology used.

Carbapenem-resistant <i>E. coli</i> prevalence was high in market wastewaters [30% (95% CI: 15.0, 45.0)] but low in humans (1%) and poultry (1%). Human, poultry, and wastewater isolates shared common resistance genes: blaCTX-M-1, <i>qnr</i>, and blaTEM. Human colonization was not significantly associated with exposure to poultry or setting (rural, farm, or market). Ninety-five percent of commercial poultry farms routinely administered antibiotics. Susceptibility tests were significantly different in household vs. farm and market poultry isolates for four of seven antibiotic classes. In human isolates, there were no differences except aminoglycoside resistance (16.4% high vs. 4.4% low exposure, p=0.02). Urban market wastewaters and poultry samples had significantly higher concentrations of ESBL-EC (p<0.001) and blaCTX-M-1 (p<0.001) compared with samples from farms and rural households.<h4>Discussion</h4>ESBL-EC colonization was high in humans but not significantly associated with exposure to poultry. Bidirectional transmission of antibiotic resistance is likely between humans, poultry, and the environment in these community settings, underlining the importance of One Health mitigation strategies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7670.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The purpose of this study was to develop a machine-learning algorithm for the prediction of survival at five years for patients with MLS and externally validate it using our institutional cohort.<h4>Methods</h4>Two databases, the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program (SEER) database and an institutional database, were used in this study. Five machine learning models were created based on the SEER database and performance was rated using the TRIPOD criteria. The model that performed best on the SEER data was again tested on our institutional database.<h4>Results</h4>The net-elastic penalized logistic regression model was the best according to our performance indicators. This model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 when compared to the SEER testing data and an AUC of 0.76 when tested against institutional database. An application to use this calculator is available at https://sorg-apps.shinyapps.io/myxoid_liposarcoma/.<h4>Conclusion</h4>MLS is a soft-tissue sarcoma with adjunct treatment options that are, in part, decided by prognostic survival. We developed the first machine-learning predictive algorithm specifically for MLS using the SEER registry that retained performance during external validation with institutional data.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

33728932,Metabolic Dyslipidemia and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Findings From the Look AHEAD Study.,"Background Metabolic dyslipidemia (high triglyceride) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The extent to which diabetes mellitus-related abnormalities in the triglyceride-HDL-C profile associates with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is incompletely understood. We evaluated the associations of triglyceride and HDL-C status with CVD outcomes in individuals with T2DM. Methods and Results We analyzed data from 4199 overweight/obese adults with T2DM free of CVD with available data on triglyceride and HDL-C at baseline (2001-2004) in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study. We used Cox proportional models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of: (1) composite CVD outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for angina, and/or death from cardiovascular causes); (2) coronary artery disease events; and (3) cerebrovascular accidents (stroke). Of the 4199 participants, 62% (n=2600) were women, with a mean age of 58 years (SD, 7), and 40% (n=1659) had metabolic dyslipidemia at baseline. Over a median follow-up of 9.5 years (interquartile range, 8.7-10.3), 500 participants experienced the composite CVD outcome, 396 experienced coronary artery disease events, and 100 experienced stroke. Low HDL-C was associated with higher hazards of the composite CVD outcome (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.64 [<i>P</i>=0.002]) and coronary artery disease events (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18-1.81 [<i>P</i>=0.001]) but not stroke (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.90-2.11 [<i>P</i>=0.140]). Compared with patients with normal triglyceride and normal HDL, participants with metabolic dyslipidemia had higher risks of the composite CVD outcome (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.03-1.63 [<i>P</i>=0.025]) and coronary artery disease events (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.14-1.93 [<i>P</i>=0.003]) but not stroke (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.74-2.05 [<i>P</i>=0.420]). Conclusions In a large sample of overweight/obese individuals with T2DM, metabolic dyslipidemia was associated with higher risks of CVD outcomes. Our findings highlight the necessity to account for metabolic dyslipidemia in CVD risk stratification among patients with T2DM.

33729791,Epigenetic Target Profiler: A Web Server to Predict Epigenetic Targets of Small Molecules.,"The identification of protein targets of small molecules is essential for drug discovery. With the increasing amount of chemogenomic data in the public domain, multiple ligand-based models for target prediction have emerged. However, these models are generally biased by the number of known ligands for different targets, which involves an under-representation of epigenetic targets, and despite the increasing importance of epigenetic targets in drug discovery, there are no open tools for epigenetic target prediction. In this work, we introduce Epigenetic Target Profiler (ETP), a freely accessible and easy-to-use web application for the prediction of epigenetic targets of small molecules. For a query compound, ETP predicts its bioactivity profile over a panel of 55 different epigenetic targets. To that aim, ETP uses a consensus model based on two binary classification models for each target, relying on support vector machines and built on molecular fingerprints of different design. A distance-to-model parameter related to the reliability of the predictions is included to facilitate their interpretability and assist in the identification of small molecules with potential epigenetic activity.

To guide this technically challenging data integration task and to make gene discovery and hypotheses generation easier for researchers, we have developed a comprehensive software package called KnetMiner which is open-source and containerized for easy use. KnetMiner is an integrated, intelligent, interactive gene and gene network discovery platform that supports scientists explore and understand the biological stories of complex traits and diseases across species. It features fast algorithms for generating rich interactive gene networks and prioritizing candidate genes based on knowledge mining approaches. KnetMiner is used in many plant science institutions and has been adopted by several plant breeding organizations to accelerate gene discovery. The software is generic and customizable and can therefore be readily applied to new species and data types; for example, it has been applied to pest insects and fungal pathogens; and most recently repurposed to support COVID-19 research. Here, we give an overview of the main approaches behind KnetMiner and we report plant-centric case studies for identifying genes, gene networks and trait relationships in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), as well as, an evidence-based approach to rank candidate genes under a large Arabidopsis thaliana QTL.

However, valuable software is in this context not only defined by a powerful algorithm to separate correct from false identifications, but also by constant maintenance and continuous improvements.<h4>Methods</h4>In 2014, we presented our peptide identification algorithm MS Amanda, showing its suitability for identifying peptides in high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry data and its ability to outperform widely used tools to identify peptides. Since then, we have continuously worked on improvements to enhance its usability and to support new trends and developments in this fast-growing field, while keeping the original scoring algorithm to assess the quality of a peptide spectrum match unchanged.<h4>Results</h4>We present the outcome of these efforts, MS Amanda 2.0, a faster and more flexible standalone version with the original scoring algorithm. The new implementation has led to a 3-5√ó speedup, is able to handle new ion types and supports standard data formats. We also show that MS Amanda 2.0 works best when using only the most common ion types in a particular search instead of all possible ion types.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MS Amanda is available free of charge from https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=msamanda.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

33766657,An early-morning gene network controlled by phytochromes and cryptochromes regulates photomorphogenesis pathways in Arabidopsis.,"Light perception at dawn plays a key role in coordinating multiple molecular processes and in entraining the plant circadian clock. The Arabidopsis mutant lacking the main photoreceptors, however, still shows clock entrainment, indicating that the integration of light into the morning transcriptome is not well understood. In this study, we performed a high-resolution RNA-sequencing time-series experiment, sampling every 2 min beginning at dawn. In parallel experiments, we perturbed temperature, the circadian clock, photoreceptor signaling, and chloroplast-derived light signaling. We used these data to infer a gene network that describes the gene expression dynamics after light stimulus in the morning, and then validated key edges. By sampling time points at high density, we are able to identify three light- and temperature-sensitive bursts of transcription factor activity, one of which lasts for only about 8 min. Phytochrome and cryptochrome mutants cause a delay in the transcriptional bursts at dawn, and completely remove a burst of expression in key photomorphogenesis genes (HY5 and BBX family). Our complete network is available online (http://www-users.york.ac.uk/‚àºde656/dawnBurst/dawnBurst.html). Taken together, our results show that phytochrome and cryptochrome signaling is required for fine-tuning the dawn transcriptional response to light, but separate pathways can robustly activate much of the program in their absence.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

33777034,TCRMatch: Predicting T-Cell Receptor Specificity Based on Sequence Similarity to Previously Characterized Receptors.,"The adaptive immune system in vertebrates has evolved to recognize non-self antigens, such as proteins expressed by infectious agents and mutated cancer cells. T cells play an important role in antigen recognition by expressing a diverse repertoire of antigen-specific receptors, which bind epitopes to mount targeted immune responses. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled the routine generation of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data. Identifying the specific epitopes targeted by different TCRs in these data would be valuable. To accomplish that, we took advantage of the ever-increasing number of TCRs with known epitope specificity curated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) since 2004. We compared seven metrics of sequence similarity to determine their power to predict if two TCRs have the same epitope specificity. We found that a comprehensive <i>k</i>-mer matching approach produced the best results, which we have implemented into TCRMatch, an openly accessible tool (http://tools.iedb.org/tcrmatch/) that takes TCR Œ≤-chain CDR3 sequences as an input, identifies TCRs with a match in the IEDB, and reports the specificity of each match. We anticipate that this tool will provide new insights into T cell responses captured in receptor repertoire and single cell sequencing experiments and will facilitate the development of new strategies for monitoring and treatment of infectious, allergic, and autoimmune diseases, as well as cancer.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,not descriptive of resource
33794377,Identifying Novel Drug Targets by iDTPnd: A Case Study of Kinase Inhibitors.,"Current FDA-approved kinase inhibitors cause diverse adverse effects, some of which are due to the mechanism-independent effects of these drugs. Identifying these mechanism-independent interactions could improve drug safety and support drug repurposing. We have developed iDTPnd (integrated Drug Target Predictor with negative dataset), a computational approach for large-scale discovery of novel targets for known drugs. For a given drug, we construct a positive and a negative structural signature that captures the weakly conserved structural features of drug binding sites. To facilitate assessment of unintended targets, iDTPnd also provides a docking-based interaction score and its statistical significance. We were able to confirm the interaction of sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib, sunitinib, and pazopanib with their known targets at a sensitivity and specificity of 52% and 55%, respectively. We have validated 10 predicted novel targets by using in vitro experiments. Our results suggest that proteins other than kinases, such as nuclear receptors, cytochrome P450, or MHC Class I molecules can also be physiologically relevant targets of kinase inhibitors. Our method is general and broadly applicable for the identification of protein-small molecule interactions, when sufficient drug-target 3D data are available.

33823117,Exploring Parental Perspectives of Childhood Speech and Language Disorders Across 10 Countries: A Pilot Qualitative Study.,"Purpose Although researchers have explored parental perspectives of childhood speech and language disorders, most studies have been conducted in English-speaking countries. Little is known about parental experiences across countries, where procedures of language screening and services for language disorders differ. The authors participated in the COST <sup>1</sup> Action network IS1406, ""Enhancing Children's Oral Language Skills Across Europe and Beyond,"" which provided an opportunity to conduct cross-country qualitative interviews with parents. The aim of this pilot study was to explore ways in which parents construed and described speech and language disorders across countries. Method Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with parents from 10 families in 10 different countries. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings The overall theme was ""acknowledging parental expertise."" The parents described, in detail, ways in which their children's speech and language (dis)abilities had an impact on the children's everyday life. Three subthemes were identified: impairment, disability, and changes over time. Conclusions The findings suggest that, across a range of countries, parents demonstrated contextualized understandings of their children's speech and language (dis)abilities, along with the everyday functional implications of the disorders. Hence, despite not holding professional knowledge about language disorders, the voices, views, understandings, and personal experiences of parents in relation to their child's disorder should be listened to when planning therapy services.

The effect of delirium in the ICU on post-hospital discharge mortality and health resource utilization is less well known.<h4>Objectives</h4>To estimate mortality and health resource utilization 2.5-years post-hospital discharge in critically ill patients admitted to ICU.<h4>Methods</h4>Population-based, propensity-score matched, retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to one of fourteen medical-surgical ICUs from January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2016. Delirium was measured by the 8-point Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcome was a composite measure of subsequent emergency department visits, hospital readmission, or mortality.<h4>Measurements and main results</h4>There were 5,936 propensity score matched patients with and without incident delirium who survived to hospital discharge. Delirium was associated with increased mortality 0 to 30-days post-hospital discharge [Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.44 (95%CI: 1.08-1.92)]. There was no significant difference in mortality more than 30 days post-hospital discharge (delirium: 3.9%, no delirium: 2.6%). There was a persistent increased risk of emergency department visits, hospital readmissions, or mortality post-hospital discharge [HR: 1.12 (95%CI: 1.07-1.17)] throughout the study period.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ICU delirium is associated with increased mortality 0 to 30 days post-hospital discharge.

33826413,"Rare, Protein-Altering Variants in <i>AS3MT</i> and Arsenic Metabolism Efficiency: A Multi-Population Association Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Common genetic variation in the arsenic methyltransferase (<i>AS3MT</i>) gene region is known to be associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME), measured as the percentage of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA%) in the urine. Rare, protein-altering variants in <i>AS3MT</i> could have even larger effects on AME, but their contribution to AME has not been investigated.<h4>Objectives</h4>We estimated the impact of rare, protein-coding variation in <i>AS3MT</i> on AME using a multi-population approach to facilitate the discovery of population-specific and shared causal rare variants.<h4>Methods</h4>We generated targeted DNA sequencing data for the coding regions of <i>AS3MT</i> for three arsenic-exposed cohorts with existing data on arsenic species measured in urine: Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS, n=2,434), Strong Heart Study (SHS, n=868), and New Hampshire Skin Cancer Study (NHSCS, n=666). We assessed the collective effects of rare (allele frequency <1%), protein-altering <i>AS3MT</i> variants on DMA%, using multiple approaches, including a test of the association between rare allele carrier status (yes/no) and DMA% using linear regression (adjusted for common variants in 10q24.32 region, age, sex, and population structure).<h4>Results</h4>We identified 23 carriers of rare-protein-altering <i>AS3MT</i> variant across all cohorts (13 in HEALS and 5 in both SHS and NHSCS), including 6 carriers of predicted loss-of-function variants. DMA% was 6-10% lower in carriers compared with noncarriers in HEALS [Œ≤=-9.4 (95% CI: -13.9, -4.8)], SHS [Œ≤=-6.9 (95% CI: -13.6, -0.2)], and NHSCS [Œ≤=-8.7 (95% CI: -15.6, -2.2)]. In meta-analyses across cohorts, DMA% was 8.7% lower in carriers [Œ≤=-8.7 (95% CI: -11.9, -5.4)].<h4>Discussion</h4>Rare, protein-altering variants in <i>AS3MT</i> were associated with lower mean DMA%, an indicator of reduced AME. Although a small percentage of the population (0.5-0.7%) carry these variants, they are associated with a 6-10% decrease in DMA% that is consistent across multiple ancestral and environmental backgrounds. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8152.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33837660,Upregulation of ZHX2 predicts poor prognosis and is correlated with immune infiltration in gastric cancer.,"The transcriptional repressor zinc finger homeobox 2 (ZHX2) is reported to regulate tumor progression in several human cancers, although little is known about its role in gastric cancer (GC). In the present study, we investigated the expression of ZHX2 and its relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of GC patients, and we also examined the effect of ZHX2 overexpression in GC cell lines. We used UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu) and the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (http://cistrome.org/TIMER) to examine ZHX2 mRNA expression, and also used Kaplan-Meier Plotter (https://kmplot.com) to determine whether ZHX2 expression was related to GC prognosis. Expression of ZHX2 protein was detected using immunohistochemical staining assays. Cell proliferation was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays, whereas apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion. We also performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org) and used The Cancer Genome Atlas database (https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Cancer-Genome-Atlas) to examine the correlation of ZHX2 with immune infiltration. We report that ZHX2 is highly expressed in GC tissues and is significantly associated with clinical characteristics. Upregulation of ZHX2 predicted poor prognosis in GC. Furthermore, ZHX2 overexpression can promote the proliferation, invasion and migration, but inhibit apoptosis, of GC cells. High expression of ZHX2 in GC is correlated with the presence of infiltrating immune cells, including B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Our data suggest that high expression of ZHX2 in GC predicts poor prognosis. In addition, ZHX2 may promote malignant behaviors of GC cells, and immune infiltration might be related to the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in GC.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not descriptive of resource
33850871,Development and validation of a prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma based on RNA-binding protein.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been found to participate in the development and progression of cancer. This present study aimed to construct a RBP-based prognostic prediction model for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).<h4>Methods</h4>RNA sequencing data and corresponding clinical information were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and served as a training set. The prediction model was validated using the dataset in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify the RBPs associated with survival. R software (http://www.r-project.org) was used for analysis in this study.<h4>Results</h4>Nine hub prognostic RBPs (<i>CIRBP, DARS2, DDX24, GAPDH, LARP6, SNRPE, WDR3, ZC3H12C, ZC3H12D</i>) were identified by univariate Cox regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Using a risk score based on the nine-hub RBP model, we separated the LUAD patients into a low-risk group and a high-risk group. The outcomes revealed that patients in the high-risk group had poorer survival than those in the low-risk group. This signature was validated in the GEO database. Further study revealed that the risk score can be an independent prognostic biomarker for LUAD. A nomogram based on the nine hub RBPs was built to quantitatively predict the prognosis of LUAD patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our nine-gene signature model could be used as a marker to predict the prognosis of LUAD and has potential for use in treatment individualization.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33855981,Competence assessment of the clinical tutor: a multicentric observational study.,"<h4>Background and aim of the study</h4>In the international literature there are no validated tools which investigate clinical tutors' skills. The main objective of the study has been to describe the clinical nurse tutor's skills, required to properly train nursing students during their educational path.<h4>Methods</h4>In this observational study a non-probability sampling has been used. The study was led in two centers: the AOUPR of Parma and the AUSL of Parma, after obtaining the favorable opinion from the Ethics Committee of the Northern Emilia Large Section. The data have been collected by using a structured and self-given survey that investigated three areas. Each item has a 4-point Likert scale, in which 1 indicates ""for nothing"" and 4 ""very much"". The data have been analyzed with the statistical software IBM SPSS v.26 ¬Æ and with the open-source statistical software Jamovi v.1.6.9 (https://www.jamovi.org.). The number of factors in the original model was reduced using several established research steps and then evaluated for data quality and construct validity using principal component analysis and confimatory factor analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Among 397 administered questionnaires, only 300, which were considered valid, have been filled. The psychometric properties of the investigation tool turned out to be good in all the areas analyzed with a Cronbach alpha higher than 0.70. The extensive process resulted in a version with 4 factors.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Nurses' answers have allowed to draw the required profile of the clinical tutors in the different organizational contexts. The results can target possible training proposals to create opportunities for the clinical tutors.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33858322,ChIP-BIT2: a software tool to detect weak binding events using a Bayesian integration approach.,"<h4>Background</h4>ChIP-seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with sequencing and identifies genome-wide binding sites for DNA binding proteins. While many binding sites have strong ChIP-seq 'peak' observations and are well captured, there are still regions bound by proteins weakly, with a relatively low ChIP-seq signal enrichment. These weak binding sites, especially those at promoters and enhancers, are functionally important because they also regulate nearby gene expression. Yet, it remains a challenge to accurately identify weak binding sites in ChIP-seq data due to the ambiguity in differentiating these weak binding sites from the amplified background DNAs.<h4>Results</h4>ChIP-BIT2 ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/chipbitc/ ) is a software package for ChIP-seq peak detection. ChIP-BIT2 employs a mixture model integrating protein and control ChIP-seq data and predicts strong or weak protein binding sites at promoters, enhancers, or other genomic locations. For binding sites at gene promoters, ChIP-BIT2 simultaneously predicts their target genes. ChIP-BIT2 has been validated on benchmark regions and tested using large-scale ENCODE ChIP-seq data, demonstrating its high accuracy and wide applicability.<h4>Conclusion</h4>ChIP-BIT2 is an efficient ChIP-seq peak caller. It provides a better lens to examine weak binding sites and can refine or extend the existing binding site collection, providing additional regulatory regions for decoding the mechanism of gene expression regulation.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
33882120,APICURON: a database to credit and acknowledge the work of biocurators.,"APICURON is an open and freely accessible resource that tracks and credits the work of biocurators across multiple participating knowledgebases. Biocuration is essential to extract knowledge from research data and make it available in a structured and standardized way to the scientific community. However, processing biological data-mainly from literature-requires a huge effort that is difficult to attribute and quantify. APICURON collects biocuration events from third-party resources and aggregates this information, spotlighting biocurator contributions. APICURON promotes biocurator engagement implementing gamification concepts like badges, medals and leaderboards and at the same time provides a monitoring service for registered resources and for biocurators themselves. APICURON adopts a data model that is flexible enough to represent and track the majority of biocuration activities. Biocurators are identified through their Open Researcher and Contributor ID. The definition of curation events, scoring systems and rules for assigning badges and medals are resource-specific and easily customizable. Registered resources can transfer curation activities on the fly through a secure and robust Application Programming Interface (API). Here, we show how simple and effective it is to connect a resource to APICURON, describing the DisProt database of intrinsically disordered proteins as a use case. We believe APICURON will provide biological knowledgebases with a service to recognize and credit the effort of their biocurators, monitor their activity and promote curator engagement.

33882829,Gene-set distance analysis (GSDA): a powerful tool for gene-set association analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Identifying sets of related genes (gene sets) that are empirically associated with a treatment or phenotype often yields valuable biological insights. Several methods effectively identify gene sets in which individual genes have simple monotonic relationships with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables. Some distance-based methods, such as distance correlations, may detect complex non-monotone associations of a gene-set with a quantitative variable that elude other methods. However, the distance correlations have yet to be generalized to associate gene-sets with categorical and censored event-time endpoints. Also, there is a need to determine which genes empirically drive the significance of an association of a gene set with an endpoint.<h4>Results</h4>We develop gene-set distance analysis (GSDA) by generalizing distance correlations to evaluate the association of a gene set with categorical and censored event-time variables. We also develop a backward elimination procedure to identify a subset of genes that empirically drive significant associations. In simulation studies, GSDA more effectively identified complex non-monotone gene-set associations than did six other published methods. In the analysis of a pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) data set, GSDA was the only method to discover that event-free survival (EFS) was associated with the 56-gene AML pathway gene-set, narrow that result down to 5 genes, and confirm the association of those 5 genes with EFS in a separate validation cohort. These results indicate that GSDA effectively identifies and characterizes complex non-monotonic gene-set associations that are missed by other methods.<h4>Conclusion</h4>GSDA is a powerful and flexible method to detect gene-set association with categorical, quantitative, or censored event-time variables, especially to detect complex non-monotonic gene-set associations.

33890543,The latest development of the DELAD project for sharing corpora of speech disorders.,"Corpora of speech of individuals with communication disorders (CSD) are invaluable resources for education and research, but they are costly and hard to build and difficult to share for various reasons. DELAD, which means 'shared' in Swedish, is a project initiated by Professors Nicole M√ºller and Martin Ball in 2015 that aims to address this issue by establishing a platform for researchers to share datasets of speech disorders with interested audiences. To date four workshops have been held, where selected participants, covering various expertise including researchers in clinical phonetics and linguistics, speech and language therapy, infrastructure specialists, and ethics and legal specialists, participated to discuss relevant issues in setting up such an archive. Positive and steady progress has been made since 2015, including refurbishing the DELAD website (http://delad.net/) with information and application forms for researchers to join and share their datasets and linking with the CLARIN K-Centre for Atypical Communication Expertise (https://ace.ruhosting.nl/) where CSD can be hosted and accessed through the CLARIN B-Centres, The Language Archive (https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/) and TalkBank (https://talkbank.org/). The latest workshop, which was funded by CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) was held as an online event in January 2021 on topics including Data Protection Impact Assessments, reviewing changes in ethics perspectives in academia on sharing CSD, and voice conversion as a mean to pseudonomise speech. This paper reports the latest progress of DELAD and discusses the directions for further advance of the initiative, with information on how researchers can contribute to the repository.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,"databases are external, this provides an interface",not life sci
33901273,Protlego: A Python package for the analysis and design of chimeric proteins.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Duplication and recombination of protein fragments have led to the highly diverse protein space that we observe today. By mimicking this natural process, the design of protein chimeras via fragment recombination has proven experimentally successful and has opened a new era for the design of customizable proteins. The in-silico building of structural models for these chimeric proteins, however, remains a manual task that requires a considerable degree of expertise and is not amenable for high-throughput studies. Energetic and structural analysis of the designed proteins often require the use of several tools, each with their unique technical difficulties and available in different programming languages or web servers.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented a Python package that enables automated, high-throughput design of chimeras and their structural analysis. First, it fetches evolutionarily conserved fragments from a built-in database (also available at fuzzle.uni-bayreuth.de). These relationships can then be represented via networks or further selected for chimera construction via recombination. Designed chimeras or natural proteins are then scored and minimised with the Charmm and Amber forcefields and their diverse structural features can be analysed at ease. Here, we showcase Protlego's pipeline by exploring the relationships between the P-loop and Rossmann superfolds, building and characterising their offspring chimeras. We believe that Protlego provides a powerful new tool for the protein design community.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Protlego runs on the Linux platform and is freely available at (https://hoecker-lab.github.io/protlego/) with tutorials and documentation and runs on Linux OS.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
33903179,Effectiveness of intravenous r-tPA versus UK for acute ischaemic stroke: a nationwide prospective Chinese registry study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) and urokinase (UK) are both recommended for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) in China, but with few comparative outcome data being available. We aimed to compare the outcomes of these two thrombolytic agents for the treatment of patients within 4.5‚Äâhours of onset of AIS in routine clinical practice in China.<h4>Methods</h4>A pre-planned, prospective, nationwide, multicentre, real-world registry of consecutive patients with AIS (age ‚â•18 years) who received r-tPA or UK within 4.5‚Äâhours of symptom onset according to local decision-making and guideline recommendations during 2017-2019. The primary effectiveness outcome was the proportion of patients with an excellent functional outcome (defined by modified Rankin scale scores 0 to 1) at 90 days. The key safety endpoint was symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage according to standard definitions. Multivariable logistic regression was used for comparative analysis, with adjustment according to propensity scores to ensure balance in baseline characteristics.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 4130 patients with AIS were registered but 320 had incomplete or missing data, leaving 3810 with available data for analysis of whom 2666 received r-tPA (median dose 0.88 (IQR 0.78-0.90)‚Äâmg/kg) and 1144 received UK (1.71 (1.43-2.00)√ó10<sup>4</sup> international unit per kilogram). There were several significant intergroup differences in patient characteristics: r-tPA patients were more educated, had less history of stroke, lower systolic blood pressure, greater neurological impairment and shorter treatment times from symptom onset than UK patients. However, in adjusted analysis, the frequency of excellent outcome (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.40, p=0.052) and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR 0.70, 95%‚ÄâCI 0.33 to 1.47, p=0.344) were similar between groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>UK may be as effective and carry a similar safety profile as r-tPA in treating mild to moderate AIS within guidelines in China.

33906374,Genetic Causes of Cardiomyopathy in Children: First Results From the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Genes Study.,"Background Pediatric cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous disease with substantial morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines recommend genetic testing in children with hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive cardiomyopathy, but practice variations exist. Robust data on clinical testing practices and diagnostic yield in children are lacking. This study aimed to identify the genetic causes of cardiomyopathy in children and to investigate clinical genetic testing practices. Methods and Results Children with familial or idiopathic cardiomyopathy were enrolled from 14 institutions in North America. Probands underwent exome sequencing. Rare sequence variants in 37 known cardiomyopathy genes were assessed for pathogenicity using consensus clinical interpretation guidelines. Of the 152 enrolled probands, 41% had a family history of cardiomyopathy. Of 81 (53%) who had undergone clinical genetic testing for cardiomyopathy before enrollment, 39 (48%) had a positive result. Genetic testing rates varied from 0% to 97% between sites. A positive family history and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy subtype were associated with increased likelihood of genetic testing (<i>P</i>=0.005 and <i>P</i>=0.03, respectively). A molecular cause was identified in an additional 21% of the 63 children who did not undergo clinical testing, with positive results identified in both familial and idiopathic cases and across all phenotypic subtypes. Conclusions A definitive molecular genetic diagnosis can be made in a substantial proportion of children for whom the cause and heritable nature of their cardiomyopathy was previously unknown. Practice variations in genetic testing are great and should be reduced. Improvements can be made in comprehensive cardiac screening and predictive genetic testing in first-degree relatives. Overall, our results support use of routine genetic testing in cases of both familial and idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

33907838,Demetra Application: An integrated genotype analysis web server for clinical genomics in endometriosis.,"Demetra Application is a holistic integrated and scalable bioinformatics web‚Äëbased tool designed to assist medical experts and researchers in the process of diagnosing endometriosis. The application identifies the most prominent gene variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) causing endometriosis using the genomic data provided for the patient by a medical expert. The present study analyzed >28.000 endometriosis‚Äërelated publications using data mining and semantic techniques aimed towards extracting the endometriosis‚Äërelated genes and SNPs. The extracted knowledge was filtered, evaluated, annotated, classified, and stored in the Demetra Application Database (DAD). Moreover, an updated gene regulatory network with the genes implements in endometriosis was established. This was followed by the design and development of the Demetra Application, in which the generated datasets and results were included. The application was tested and presented herein with whole‚Äëexome sequencing data from seven related patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis‚Äërelated SNPs and variants identified in genome‚Äëwide association studies (GWAS), whole‚Äëgenome (WGS), whole‚Äëexome (WES), or targeted sequencing information were classified, annotated and analyzed in a consolidated patient profile with clinical significance information. Probable genes associated with the patient's genomic profile were visualized using several graphs, including chromosome ideograms, statistic bars and regulatory networks through data mining studies with relative publications, in an effort to obtain a representative number of the most credible candidate genes and biological pathways associated with endometriosis. An evaluation analysis was performed on seven patients from a three‚Äëgeneration family with endometriosis. All the recognized gene variants that were previously considered to be associated with endometriosis were properly identified in the output profile per patient, and by comparing the results, novel findings emerged.

33939828,PE-Designer and PE-Analyzer: web-based design and analysis tools for CRISPR prime editing.,"Prime editing technology is capable of generating targeted insertions, deletions, and base conversions. However, the process of designing prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs), which contain a primer binding site and a reverse-transcription template at the 3' end, is more complex than that for the single guide RNAs used with CRISPR nucleases or base editors. Furthermore, the assessment of high-throughput sequencing data after prime editors (PEs) have been employed should consider the unique feature of PEs; thus, pre-existing assessment tools cannot directly be adopted for PEs. Here, we present two user-friendly web-based tools for PEs, named PE-Designer and PE-Analyzer. PE-Designer, a dedicated tool for pegRNA selection, provides all possible target sequences, pegRNA extension sequences, and nicking guide RNA sequences together with useful information, and displays the results in an interactive image. PE-Analyzer, a dedicated tool for PE outcome analysis, accepts high-throughput sequencing data, summarizes mutation-related information in a table, and provides interactive graphs. PE-Analyzer was mainly written using JavaScript so that it can analyze several data sets without requiring that huge sequencing data (>100MB) be uploaded to the server, reducing analysis time and increasing personal security.

An analysis of different computerized techniques for CIMT measurement and their clinical impacts on the same patient data set is lacking. Here we compared and assessed five computerized CIMT algorithms against three expert analysts' manual measurements on a data set of 1088 patients from two centers. Inter- and intra-observer variability was assessed, and the computerized CIMT values were compared with those manually obtained. The CIMT measurements were used to assess the correlation with clinical parameters, cardiovascular event prediction through a generalized linear model and the Kaplan-Meier hazard ratio. CIMT measurements obtained with a skilled analyst's segmentation and the computerized segmentation were comparable in statistical analyses, suggesting they can be used interchangeably for CIMT quantification and clinical outcome investigation.

A cell lineage on its own, however, is simply a description of cell divisions as branching events. A major goal of current research is to integrate this description of cell relationships with information about the spatial distribution and identities of the cells those divisions produce. Visualizing, interpreting and exploring these complex data in an intuitive manner requires the development of new tools. Here we present CeLaVi, a web-based visualization tool that allows users to navigate and interact with a representation of cell lineages, whilst simultaneously visualizing the spatial distribution, identities and properties of cells. CeLaVi's principal functions include the ability to explore and manipulate the cell lineage tree; to visualise the spatial distribution of cell clones at different depths of the tree; to colour cells in the 3D viewer based on lineage relationships; to visualise various cell qualities on the 3D viewer (e.g. gene expression, cell type) and to annotate selected cells/clones.

However, studies on sIGF-1 among children from low-income countries are few, and the role of body composition is unknown.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the associations of anthropometry, body composition, inflammation, and breastfeeding with sIGF-1 among children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional study based on admission data from 6- to 23-mo-old children with MAM participating in a nutrition intervention trial (Treatfood) in Burkina Faso. Linear regression analysis was used to identify correlates of sIGF-1.<h4>Results</h4>Among 1546 children, the median (IQR) sIGF-1 was 12 (8.2-18.3) ng/mL. sIGF-1 was highest at 6 mo, with a nadir ‚àº10-11 mo, and higher in girls than boys. Length-for-age z score (LAZ), weight-for-length z score (WLZ), and midupper arm circumference were positively associated with sIGF-1 (P ‚â§ 0.001). Fat-free mass (FFM) was also positively associated, as sIGF-1 increased 1.5 (95% CI: 0.5, 2.5) ng/mL for each 1-kg increase in FFM. However, the association disappeared after adjustment for height. Elevated serum C-reactive protein and Œ±1-acid glycoprotein were negatively associated with sIGF-1 (P ‚â§ 0.001), as was fever (P < 0.001) but not a positive malaria test per se (P = 0.15). Children never breastfed had lower sIGF-1 (-5.1; 95% CI: -9.8, -0.3).<h4>Conclusions</h4>LAZ and WLZ were positively and inflammation negatively associated with sIGF-1. As all children were moderately malnourished and many had inflammation, this probably explains the very low median sIGF-1. The association of FFM with sIGF-1 was fully explained by height. There was a marked age pattern, with a nadir in late infancy, confirming findings from smaller studies from well-nourished populations.

However, since many of the analyses applied to methionine modification can be extended to other modifications, the package can be useful to thoroughly analyze post-translational modifications in general. Thus, within a single software environment ptm can integrate information from up to 11 databases covering 9 modifications. Different functions can work coordinately to form pipelines allowing the programmatic analysis of thousands of proteins. Alternatively, the user can simultaneously perform different analyses on the same protein of interest, combining the results in a single output. The flexibility of ptm makes it a suitable tool to address site- and protein-centric hypotheses related to post-translational modifications. Accompanying the package we maintain a web page containing extended documentation and examples of the tasks that can be performed with ptm.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>ptm is implemented in R. Release versions are available via CRAN and work on all major operating systems. The development version is maintained at https://bitbucket.org/jcaledo/ptm. Extended documentation can be found at https://metositeptm.com.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
33964537,Children's understanding of epilepsy: A qualitative study.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To use a qualitative research approach to determine children's understandings of epilepsy and their epilepsy treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>Children aged 7-16‚ÄØyears with physician-confirmed active epilepsy (i.e., having had an epileptic seizure in the past year and or currently taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and not known to have an intellectual disability, were invited to participate. Children had semi-structured interviews separately on two occasions. Between the first and second interviews, an observation of a routine epilepsy clinic appointment of individual children was conducted, and was then discussed during the second interview. Participatory research tools were used in both child interviews to facilitate discussions. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed, pseudonymized and entered into NVivo (version 12, QSR International). Data were analyzed using a thematic approach.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-three children of mean age 10.1‚ÄØyears (range 8-14), mean duration of epilepsy of 4.6‚ÄØyears (range 2-10) were enrolled. Twelve were 12 female; 7 had focal, 14 had generalized, and 2 had combined epilepsy; 20 were on monotherapy; and 16 had tried previous AEDs. All had an initial (first) interview; 20 were observed during a clinic appointment and had a second interview. Five broad themes emerged: understanding of epilepsy; understanding of seizures; understanding of medication; understanding of children's role in clinical appointments; influences on children's understanding. Children spoke about what epilepsy meant by describing the physical sensations of having a seizure or through the act of taking medication. Children described the role they had, or felt they should have, but reported challenges in being meaningfully involved in clinical appointments. While healthcare professionals were initial information nodes, epilepsy information from parents appeared to be more significant for children.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The perspectives of children with epilepsy are valuable for clinicians to understand; assumptions should not be made that children's views can be accessed via parents. Clinicians need to be constantly aware of children's views and ways of understanding and communicating about their epilepsy. To support this, the research - drawing on children's words, meanings, and stories - was used to inform an easily accessible, gender-neutral, animation about epilepsy that provides information about the condition, seizures, and medication (https://youtu.be/MO7xXL2ZXP8).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33970805,Medicinal plant compounds as promising inhibitors of coronavirus (COVID-19) main protease: an <i>in silico</i> study.,"The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe and has involved more than 215 countries and territories. Due to a lack of effective therapy or vaccine, urgent and concerted efforts are needed to identify therapeutic targets and medications. COVID-19 main protease represents a major target for drug treatment to inhibit viral function. The present study sought to evaluate medicinal plant compounds as potential inhibitors of the COVID-19 main protease using molecular docking and molecular dynamic analysis. The PDB files of COVID-19 main protease and some medicinal plant compounds were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and Pubchem server, respectively. The Gromacs software was used for simulation studies, and molecular docking analysis was done using Autodock 4.2. The COVID-19 main protease simulation, compared with some phytochemicals docked to the COVID-19 main protease, were analyzed. Glabridin, catechin, and fisetin had the greatest tendency to interact with the COVID-19 main protease by hydrogen and hydrophobic interactions. Docking of these phytochemicals to COVID-19 main protease led to an increase in the radius of gyration (Rg), decrease in the Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), and induced variation in COVID-19 main protease secondary structure. The high tendency interaction of glabridin, catechin, and fisetin to COVID-19 main protease induced conformational changes on this enzyme. These interactions can lead to enzyme inhibition. This simulated study indicates that these phytochemicals may be considered as potent inhibitors of the viral protease; however, more investigations are required to explore their potential medicinal use.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

33970835,"""Just Engage in It or Not, You Get Out What You Put In"": Student and Staff Experiences of Feedback and Feedforward in Workplace-Based Learning Environments.","Feedback is central to student learning in the veterinary workplace. Feedforward, a related concept, is used to describe the way information about a student's performance may be used to improve their future performance. Feedback and feedforward practices are diverse, with varied student and staff understandings of the nature and purpose of feedback (feedback literacy). This study compared the practices of feedback and feedforward in a range of programs in one institution during student transitions from the classroom to workplace-based learning environments. The study adopted a broad inter-professional approach to include health care programs as well as social work and theater and performance studies. Profession-specific focus groups were conducted with contribution from 28 students and 31 staff from five different professions. Thematic analysis revealed that students and staff shared an understanding of the feedback and feedforward concepts, and both groups recognized the importance of emotional and relational aspects of the process. Students and staff across all professions recognized the impact of time constraints on the feedback process, although this was particularly highlighted in the health science professions. Social work and theater and performance studies students demonstrated a more nuanced understanding of the emotional and relational aspects of feedback and feedforward. Overall, the approach highlights similarities and differences in practices and experiences in different workplace contexts, creating opportunities for cross-disciplinary learning, which may have relevance more widely in higher education programs with workplace-based elements. The study underpinned the development of the LeapForward feedback training resource (https://bilt.online/the-leapforward-project/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not life sci
33972020,REP2: A Web Server to Detect Common Tandem Repeats in Protein Sequences.,"Ensembles of tandem repeats (TRs) in protein sequences expand rapidly to form domains well suited for interactions with proteins. For this reason, they are relatively frequent. Some TRs have known structures and therefore it is advantageous to predict their presence in a protein sequence. However, since most TRs diverge quickly, their detection by classical sequence comparison algorithms is not very accurate. Previously, we developed a method and a web server that used curated profiles and thresholds for the detection of 11 common TRs. Here we present a new web server (REP2) that allows the analysis of TRs in both individual and aligned sequences. We provide currently precomputed analyses for a selection of 78 UniProt reference proteomes. We illustrate how these data can be used to study the evolution of TRs using comparative genomics.

33980298,IDSM ChemWebRDF: SPARQLing small-molecule datasets.,"The Resource Description Framework (RDF), together with well-defined ontologies, significantly increases data interoperability and usability. The SPARQL query language was introduced to retrieve requested RDF data and to explore links between them. Among other useful features, SPARQL supports federated queries that combine multiple independent data source endpoints. This allows users to obtain insights that are not possible using only a single data source. Owing to all of these useful features, many biological and chemical databases present their data in RDF, and support SPARQL querying. In our project, we primary focused on PubChem, ChEMBL and ChEBI small-molecule datasets. These datasets are already being exported to RDF by their creators. However, none of them has an official and currently supported SPARQL endpoint. This omission makes it difficult to construct complex or federated queries that could access all of the datasets, thus underutilising the main advantage of the availability of RDF data. Our goal is to address this gap by integrating the datasets into one database called the Integrated Database of Small Molecules (IDSM) that will be accessible through a SPARQL endpoint. Beyond that, we will also focus on increasing mutual interoperability of the datasets. To realise the endpoint, we decided to implement an in-house developed SPARQL engine based on the PostgreSQL relational database for data storage. In our approach, data are stored in the traditional relational form, and the SPARQL engine translates incoming SPARQL queries into equivalent SQL queries. An important feature of the engine is that it optimises the resulting SQL queries. Together with optimisations performed by PostgreSQL, this allows efficient evaluations of SPARQL queries. The endpoint provides not only querying in the dataset, but also the compound substructure and similarity search supported by our Sachem project. Although the endpoint is accessible from an internet browser, it is mainly intended to be used for programmatic access by other services, for example as a part of federated queries. For regular users, we offer a rich web application called ChemWebRDF using the endpoint. The application is publicly available at https://idsm.elixir-czech.cz/chemweb/ .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,interface to another database,
33982946,"Clinical Impact of Rectal Hyposensitivity: A Cross-Sectional Study of 2,876 Patients With Refractory Functional Constipation.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Normal bowel function requires intact sensory pathways. Diminished rectal sensation (rectal hyposensitivity [RH]) is associated with constipation, although its clinical importance remains unclear.<h4>Methods</h4>Consecutive patients (aged 18-80) attending a tertiary center (2004-2016) for investigation of refractory functional constipation (Rome IV core criteria defined, applied post hoc) were included. Patients completed a clinical symptom questionnaire and underwent anorectal physiologic investigations, including rectal sensory testing (balloon distension) to determine 3 well-established sensory thresholds. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between RH, symptomology, and allied physiologic investigations.<h4>Results</h4>Of 2,876 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 722 (25%) had RH based on ‚â•1 elevated sensory thresholds (0: n = 2,154 [74.9%]; 1: n = 327 [11.4%]; 2: n = 209 [7.3%]; and 3: n = 186 [6.5%]). A linear relationship existed between increasing number of elevated sensory thresholds and constipation severity (Cleveland Clinic constipation score: mean difference per threshold [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.48-0.90]; P < 0.001). Several symptoms were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with RH including: infrequent defecation (odds ratio 1.29 [1.17-1.42]), painful evacuation (1.15 [1.05-1.27]), prolonged toileting (1.14 [1.05-1.24]), and digitation or enema use (1.18 [1.08-1.30]). On defecography, a ""functional"" evacuation disorder was also associated with RH (1.37 [1.25-1.50], P < 0.001), as was megarectum (2.52 [2.08-3.05], P < 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>RH occurs in 25% of patients with refractory functional constipation. Increased number of elevated sensory thresholds is associated with more severe constipation phenotype. These data, in the largest study to date, provide for the first time evidence to show that RH is a major pathophysiologic mechanism in constipation, with recognized clinical impact (http://links.lww.com/AJG/B765).(Equation is included in full-text article.).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

However, available benchmarks show that all next-generation sequencing (NGS) CNV calling tools produce false positives. We developed CNVfilteR, an R package that uses the single nucleotide variant calls usually obtained in germline NGS pipelines to identify those false positives. The package can detect both false deletions and false duplications. We evaluated CNVfilteR performance on callsets generated by 13 CNV calling tools on 3 whole-genome sequencing and 541 panel samples, showing a decrease of up to 44.8% in false positives and consistent F1-score increase. Using CNVfilteR to detect false-positive calls can improve the overall performance of existing CNV calling pipelines.<h4>Availability</h4>CNVfilteR is released under Artistic-2.0 License.

Fast, inclusive and adaptive methods are required for the heterogenous SARS-CoV-2 sequence data generated at an unprecedented rate.<h4>Results</h4>We present an updated version of the SARS-CoV-2 analysis module of our automated computational pipeline, Infectious Pathogen Detector (IPD) 2.0, to perform genomic analysis to understand the variability and dynamics of the virus. It adopts the recent clade nomenclature and demonstrates the clade prediction accuracy of 92.8%. IPD 2.0 also contains a SARS-CoV-2 updater module, allowing automatic upgrading of the variant database using genome sequences from GISAID. As a proof of principle, analyzing 208,911 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we generate an extensive database of 2.58 million sample-wise variants. A comparative account of lineage-specific mutations in the newer SARS-CoV-2 strains emerging in the UK, South Africa and Brazil and data reported from India identify overlapping and lineages specific acquired mutations suggesting a repetitive convergent and adaptive evolution.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel and dynamic feature of the SARS-CoV-2 module of IPD 2.0 makes it a contemporary tool to analyze the diverse and growing genomic strains of the virus and serve as a vital tool to help facilitate rapid genomic surveillance in a population to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections.

33997237,Comparative proteomics of <i>Brucella melitensis</i> is a useful toolbox for developing prophylactic interventions in a One-Health context.,"Brucellosis caused by <i>Brucella melitensis</i> is a zoonosis frequently reported in the Mediterranean and Middle-East regions and responsible for important economic losses and reduced animal welfare. To date, current strategies applied to control or eradicate the disease relies on diagnostic tests that suffer from limited specificity in non-vaccinated animals; while prophylactic measures, when applied, use a live attenuated bacterial strain characterized by residual virulence on adult pregnant animals and difficulties in distinguishing vaccinated from infected animals. To overcome these issues, studies are desired to elucidate the bacterial biology and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both the vaccinal strain and the pathogenic strains. Proteomics has a potential in tackling issues of One-Health concern; here, we employed label-free shotgun proteomics to investigate the protein repertoire of the vaccinal strain <i>B. melitensis</i> Rev.1 and compare it with the proteome of the <i>Brucella melitensis</i> 16 M, a reference strain representative of <i>B. melitensis</i> field strains. Comparative proteomics profiling underlines common and diverging traits between the two strains. Common features suggest the potential biochemical routes responsible for the residual virulence of the vaccinal strain, whilst the diverging traits are suggestive biochemical signatures to be further investigated to provide an optimized diagnostic capable of discriminating the vaccinated from infected animals.

34000199,A Deep Learning Enhanced Novel Software Tool for Laryngeal Dynamics Analysis.,"Purpose High-speed videoendoscopy (HSV) is an emerging, but barely used, endoscopy technique in the clinic to assess and diagnose voice disorders because of the lack of dedicated software to analyze the data. HSV allows to quantify the vocal fold oscillations by segmenting the glottal area. This challenging task has been tackled by various studies; however, the proposed approaches are mostly limited and not suitable for daily clinical routine. Method We developed a user-friendly software in C# that allows the editing, motion correction, segmentation, and quantitative analysis of HSV data. We further provide pretrained deep neural networks for fully automatic glottis segmentation. Results We freely provide our software Glottis Analysis Tools (GAT). Using GAT, we provide a general threshold-based region growing platform that enables the user to analyze data from various sources, such as in vivo recordings, ex vivo recordings, and high-speed footage of artificial vocal folds. Additionally, especially for in vivo recordings, we provide three robust neural networks at various speed and quality settings to allow a fully automatic glottis segmentation needed for application by untrained personnel. GAT further evaluates video and audio data in parallel and is able to extract various features from the video data, among others the glottal area waveform, that is, the changing glottal area over time. In total, GAT provides 79 unique quantitative analysis parameters for video- and audio-based signals. Many of these parameters have already been shown to reflect voice disorders, highlighting the clinical importance and usefulness of the GAT software. Conclusion GAT is a unique tool to process HSV and audio data to determine quantitative, clinically relevant parameters for research, diagnosis, and treatment of laryngeal disorders.

Although the number of hospital patients using interventions such as the video consultation has increased in recent years only a small proportion of the outpatient and inpatient visits involve telemedicine. The TELEMED database (https://telemedicine.cimt.dk/) has been launched at the Center for Innovative Medical Technology in Denmark to ensure that hospital managers and healthcare professionals have access to information about telemedicine services and their effectiveness. This article describes the development and the content of the TELEMED database.<h4>Methods</h4>A structured literature search was made in the PubMed Database for randomised controlled trials or observational studies with a control group that investigated the effect of telemedicine interventions for hospital patients. Data were extracted from each article on the clinical effectiveness, patient perceptions, economic effects and implementation challenges. As the database should only provide inspiration to healthcare professionals regarding possibilities for use of telemedicine, the risk of bias in the studies was not assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The literature search resulted in 2825 hits. Based on full text assessment, 331 articles were included for data extraction and assessment. These articles present telemedicine services used in 22 different medical specialities. Forty-eight percent of the studies found a positive, statistically significant clinical effect, while 47% showed no statistically significant difference. In 48% of the studies, patients' experiences were examined and of these 68% found positive patient experiences. Fifty-four percent of the articles included information on the economic effects and, of these, 51% found reduction in healthcare utilization. In the majority of studies between two and four types of implementation challenges were found.<b>Conclusions and recommendations:</b> The TELEMED database provides an easily accessible overview of existing evidence-based telemedicine services for use by hospital managers and health professionals, who whish to to implement telemedicine.

34004273,Klebsiella MALDI TypeR: a web-based tool for Klebsiella identification based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.,"Klebsiella pathogens affect human and animal health and are widely distributed in the environment. Among these, the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, which includes seven phylogroups, is an important cause of community and hospital infections. The Klebsiella oxytoca species complex also causes hospital infections and antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis. The unsuitability of currently used clinical microbiology methods to distinguish species within each of these species complexes leads to high rates of misidentifications that are masking the true clinical significance and potential epidemiological specificities of individual species. We developed a web-based tool, Klebsiella MALDI TypeR, a platform-independent and user-friendly application that enables uploading MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data in order to identify Klebsiella isolates at the species complex and phylogroup levels. The tool, available at https://maldityper.pasteur.fr/, leverages a database of previously identified biomarkers that are specific for species complexes, individual phylogroups, or related phylogroups. We obtained 84%-100% identification accuracy depending on phylogroup. Identification results are obtained in a few seconds from batches of uploaded spectral data. Klebsiella MALDI TypeR enables fast and reliable identification of Klebsiella strains that are often misidentified with standard microbiological methods.

34012710,A Comparison of Methods for Studying the Tumor Microenvironment's Spatial Heterogeneity in Digital Pathology Specimens.,"<h4>Background</h4>The tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous, and it is understood to affect tumor progression and patient outcome. A number of studies have reported the prognostic significance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and tumor budding in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the significance of the intratumoral heterogeneity present in the spatial distribution of these features within the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) has not been previously reported. Evaluating this intratumoral heterogeneity may aid the understanding of the TIME's effect on patient prognosis as well as identify novel aggressive phenotypes which can be further investigated as potential targets for new treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>In this study, we propose and apply two spatial statistical methodologies for the evaluation of the intratumor heterogeneity present in the distribution of CD3 <sup>+</sup> and CD8 <sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and tumor buds (TB) in 232 Stage II CRC cases. Getis-Ord hotspot analysis was applied to quantify the cold and hotspots, defined as regions with a significantly low or high number of each feature of interest, respectively. A novel spatial heatmap methodology for the quantification of the cold and hotspots of each feature of interest, which took into account both the interpatient heterogeneity and the intratumor heterogeneity, was further developed.<h4>Results</h4>Resultant data from each analysis, characterizing the spatial intratumor heterogeneity of lymphocytes and TBs were used for the development of two new highly prognostic risk models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results highlight the value of applying spatial statistics for the assessment of the intratumor heterogeneity. Both Getis-Ord hotspot and our proposed spatial heatmap analysis are broadly applicable across other tissue types as well as other features of interest.<h4>Availability</h4>The code underpinning this publication can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.17630/c2306fe9-66e2-4442-ad89-f986220053e2.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

34018555,MesKit: a tool kit for dissecting cancer evolution of multi-region tumor biopsies through somatic alterations.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multi-region sequencing (MRS) has been widely used to analyze intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) and cancer evolution. However, comprehensive analysis of mutational data from MRS is still challenging, necessitating complicated integration of a plethora of computational and statistical approaches.<h4>Findings</h4>Here, we present MesKit, an R/Bioconductor package that can assist in characterizing genetic ITH and tracing the evolutionary history of tumors based on somatic alterations detected by MRS. MesKit provides a wide range of analysis and visualization modules, including ITH evaluation, metastatic route inference, and mutational signature identification. In addition, MesKit implements an auto-layout algorithm to generate phylogenetic trees based on somatic mutations. The application of MesKit for 2 reported MRS datasets of hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer identified known heterogeneous features and evolutionary patterns, together with potential driver events during cancer evolution.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, MesKit is useful for interpreting ITH and tracing evolutionary trajectory based on MRS data. MesKit is implemented in R and available at https://bioconductor.org/packages/MesKit under the GPL v3 license.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34019643,eVITTA: a web-based visualization and inference toolbox for transcriptome analysis.,"Transcriptome profiling is essential for gene regulation studies in development and disease. Current web-based tools enable functional characterization of transcriptome data, but most are restricted to applying gene-list-based methods to single datasets, inefficient in leveraging up-to-date and species-specific information, and limited in their visualization options. Additionally, there is no systematic way to explore data stored in the largest transcriptome repository, NCBI GEO. To fill these gaps, we have developed eVITTA (easy Visualization and Inference Toolbox for Transcriptome Analysis; https://tau.cmmt.ubc.ca/eVITTA/). eVITTA provides modules for analysis and exploration of studies published in NCBI GEO (easyGEO), detailed molecular- and systems-level functional profiling (easyGSEA), and customizable comparisons among experimental groups (easyVizR). We tested eVITTA on transcriptomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected human nasopharyngeal swab samples, and identified a downregulation of olfactory signal transducers, in line with the clinical presentation of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. We also analyzed transcriptomes of Caenorhabditis elegans worms with disrupted S-adenosylmethionine metabolism, confirming activation of innate immune responses and feedback induction of one-carbon cycle genes. Collectively, eVITTA streamlines complex computational workflows into an accessible interface, thus filling the gap of an end-to-end platform capable of capturing both broad and granular changes in human and model organism transcriptomes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
34019656,Amino Acid Interactions (INTAA) web server v2.0: a single service for computation of energetics and conservation in biomolecular 3D structures.,"Interactions among amino acid residues are the principal contributor to the stability of the three-dimensional structure of a protein. The Amino Acid Interactions (INTAA) web server (https://bioinfo.uochb.cas.cz/INTAA/) has established itself as a unique computational resource, which enables users to calculate the contribution of individual residues in a biomolecular structure to its total energy using a molecular mechanical scoring function. In this update, we describe major additions to the web server which help solidify its position as a robust, comprehensive resource for biomolecular structure analysis. Importantly, a new continuum solvation model was introduced, allowing more accurate representation of electrostatic interactions in aqueous media. In addition, a low-overhead pipeline for the estimation of evolutionary conservation in protein chains has been added. New visualization options were introduced as well, allowing users to easily switch between and interrelate the energetic and evolutionary views of the investigated structures.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
34019657,ProteinTools: a toolkit to analyze protein structures.,"The experimental characterization and computational prediction of protein structures has become increasingly rapid and precise. However, the analysis of protein structures often requires researchers to use several software packages or web servers, which complicates matters. To provide long-established structural analyses in a modern, easy-to-use interface, we implemented ProteinTools, a web server toolkit for protein structure analysis. ProteinTools gathers four applications so far, namely the identification of hydrophobic clusters, hydrogen bond networks, salt bridges, and contact maps. In all cases, the input data is a PDB identifier or an uploaded structure, whereas the output is an interactive dynamic web interface. Thanks to the modular nature of ProteinTools, the addition of new applications will become an easy task. Given the current need to have these tools in a single, fast, and interpretable interface, we believe that ProteinTools will become an essential toolkit for the wider protein research community.

34020445,Effect on gut microbiota of a 1-y lifestyle intervention with Mediterranean diet compared with energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity promotion: PREDIMED-Plus Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Mediterranean diet is a well-recognized healthy diet that has shown to induce positive changes in gut microbiota. Lifestyle changes such as diet along with physical activity could aid in weight loss and improve cardiovascular risk factors.<h4>Objectives</h4>To investigate the effect of an intensive lifestyle weight loss intervention on gut microbiota.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a substudy of the PREDIMED-Plus (Prevenci√≥n con Dieta Mediterr√°nea-Plus), a randomized controlled trial conducted in overweight/obese men and women (aged 55-75 y) with metabolic syndrome. The intervention group (IG) underwent an intensive weight loss lifestyle intervention based on an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and physical activity promotion, and the control group (CG) underwent a non-energy-restricted MedDiet for 1 y. Anthropometric, biochemical, and gut microbial 16S rRNA sequencing data were analyzed at baseline (n = 362) and 1-y follow-up (n = 343).<h4>Results</h4>IG participants had a weight loss of 4.2 (IQR, -6.8, -2.5) kg compared with 0.2 (IQR, -2.1, 1.4) kg in the CG (P < 0.001). Reductions in BMI, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and triglycerides and an increase in HDL cholesterol were greater in IG than in CG participants (P < 0.05). We observed a decrease in Butyricicoccus, Haemophilus, Ruminiclostridium 5, and Eubacterium hallii in the IG compared with the CG. Many genera shifted in the same direction within both intervention groups, indicating an overall effect of the MedDiet. Decreases in Haemophilus, Coprococcus 3, and few other genera were associated with a decrease in adiposity parameters in both intervention groups. Changes in Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 were positively associated with changes in MedDiet adherence.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Weight loss induced by an energy-restricted MedDiet and physical activity induce changes in gut microbiota. The role of MedDiet-induced changes on the host might be via short-chain fatty acid producing bacteria, whereas with energy restriction, these changes might be modulated with other mechanisms, which need to be explored in future studies.

34025412,The Genus <i>Eriosema</i> (Fabaceae): From the Ethnopharmacology to an Evidence-Based Phytotherapeutic Perspective?,"The genus <i>Eriosema</i> (Fabaceae) includes approximately 150 species widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Africa, Neotropics, Asia and Australia). Throughout these regions, several species are used since centuries in different traditional medicinal systems, while others are used as food or food supplement. The present review attempts to critically summarize current information concerning the uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of the <i>Eriosema</i> genus and to evaluate the therapeutic potential. The information published in English and French (up to September 2020) on ethnopharmacology or traditional uses, chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of <i>Eriosema</i> genus was collected from electronic databases [SciFinder, PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Prelude Medicinal Plants-http://www.ethnopharmacologia.org/recherche-dans-prelude/?plant, The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org/), POWO (http://powo.science.kew.org/) and IUCN Red List Categories (https://www.iucnredlist.org/)], conference proceedings, books, M.Sc. and Ph.D. dissertations. The information retrieved on the ethnomedicinal indications of <i>Eriosema</i> genus allowed to list 25 species (‚àº16.6% of the genus). The majority of uses is recorded from Africa. Phytochemical analyses of 8 species led to the identification and/or isolation of 107 compounds, with flavonoids (69.2%), chromones (7.5%) and benzoic acid derivatives (3.7%) as the main chemical classes. Pharmacological investigations with crude extracts and isolated compounds showed a broad range of activities including aphrodisiac, estrogenic, anti-osteoporosis, hypolipidemic, anti-diabetic, anti-diarrheal, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anthelmintic, anti-cancer, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. Despite the low number of <i>Eriosema</i> species tested, there is convincing evidence in <i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies validating some traditional and ethnobotanical uses. However, the utility of several of the described uses has not yet been confirmed in pharmacological studies. Reviewed data could serve as a reference tool and preliminary information for advanced research on <i>Eriosema</i> species.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not descriptive of the resource

Existing evidence suggests that sexual issues are poorly handled during the rehabilitation phase of the patient's journey.<h4>Design</h4>A descriptive qualitative design was utilized in this study.<h4>Methods</h4>Twenty-nine people with spinal cord injury participated in qualitative in-depth interviews between November 2017 and April 2018, and data were analysed using the Burnard (1991, https://doi.org/10.1016/0260-6917(91)90009-y) thematic analysis framework.<h4>Results</h4>Some participants indicated they were sexually inactive prior to their spinal cord injury. They testified that they had not received information on post-injury sexual functioning. Many participants who received post-injury information on sexual functioning reported dissatisfaction with the content and timing of this information.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Personal conversations between spinal cord injured patients and dedicated members of the interdisciplinary health team can enhance the quality of rehabilitation care and patients' satisfaction with rehabilitation care. Nurses are central clinicians in the rehabilitation programme of spinal cord injured patients and should engage in individually designed conversations about post-injury sexual functioning.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34037798,CPA: a web-based platform for consensus pathway analysis and interactive visualization.,"In molecular biology and genetics, there is a large gap between the ease of data collection and our ability to extract knowledge from these data. Contributing to this gap is the fact that living organisms are complex systems whose emerging phenotypes are the results of multiple complex interactions taking place on various pathways. This demands powerful yet user-friendly pathway analysis tools to translate the now abundant high-throughput data into a better understanding of the underlying biological phenomena. Here we introduce Consensus Pathway Analysis (CPA), a web-based platform that allows researchers to (i) perform pathway analysis using eight established methods (GSEA, GSA, FGSEA, PADOG, Impact Analysis, ORA/Webgestalt, KS-test, Wilcox-test), (ii) perform meta-analysis of multiple datasets, (iii) combine methods and datasets to accurately identify the impacted pathways underlying the studied condition and (iv) interactively explore impacted pathways, and browse relationships between pathways and genes. The platform supports three types of input: (i) a list of differentially expressed genes, (ii) genes and fold changes and (iii) an expression matrix. It also allows users to import data from NCBI GEO. The CPA platform currently supports the analysis of multiple organisms using KEGG and Gene Ontology, and it is freely available at http://cpa.tinnguyen-lab.com.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

Published guidelines recommend that patients with ten or more adenomas be referred for genetic testing, based on evidence that colorectal cancer risk is associated with adenoma multiplicity.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to determine adherence to guidelines on referral for genetic screening in patients with ten or more adenomas.<h4>Design</h4>A cross-sectional study was performed of prospectively collected data from the United Kingdom Bowel Cancer Screening Program between May 2007 and June 2018. Only histologically confirmed adenomas were included. Clinicopathological data were recorded from patient records and referrals to clinical genetics services were ascertained.<h4>Setting</h4>Data were obtained from three centers in London, United Kingdom.<h4>Patients</h4>A total of 17,450 subjects underwent colonoscopy following an abnormal fecal occult blood test.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>We quantified patients with ten or more adenomas and the proportion referred for genetic screening.<h4>Results</h4>The adenoma detection rate was 50.6% amongst 17,450 patients who underwent colonoscopy (8,831 had one or more adenomas). 347 patients (2.0%) had 10 or more adenomas. Patients with 10 or more adenomas were more likely to be male than those with less than 10 adenomas (76.9% vs. 53.4%; p<0.0001). A family history was collected in 37.8% of the multiple adenoma population. Of 347 patients with 10 or more adenomas, 28 (8.1%) were referred for genetic assessment.<h4>Limitations</h4>All three screening centers were in a single city. No genetic outcome data were available to permit analysis of actual rates of inherited cancer syndromes in this population.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, almost one in fifty patients had ten or more adenomas. Despite guidelines advising genetic testing in this group, referral rates are low. A referral pathway and management strategies should be established to address this patient population.

34040621,Easymap: A User-Friendly Software Package for Rapid Mapping-by-Sequencing of Point Mutations and Large Insertions.,"Mapping-by-sequencing strategies combine next-generation sequencing (NGS) with classical linkage analysis, allowing rapid identification of the causal mutations of the phenotypes exhibited by mutants isolated in a genetic screen. Computer programs that analyze NGS data obtained from a mapping population of individuals derived from a mutant of interest to identify a causal mutation are available; however, the installation and usage of such programs requires bioinformatic skills, modifying or combining pieces of existing software, or purchasing licenses. To ease this process, we developed Easymap, an open-source program that simplifies the data analysis workflows from raw NGS reads to candidate mutations. Easymap can perform bulked segregant mapping of point mutations induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) with DNA-seq or RNA-seq datasets, as well as tagged-sequence mapping for large insertions, such as transposons or T-DNAs. The mapping analyses implemented in Easymap have been validated with experimental and simulated datasets from different plant and animal model species. Easymap was designed to be accessible to all users regardless of their bioinformatics skills by implementing a user-friendly graphical interface, a simple universal installation script, and detailed mapping reports, including informative images and complementary data for assessment of the mapping results. Easymap is available at http://genetics.edu.umh.es/resources/easymap; its Quickstart Installation Guide details the recommended procedure for installation.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

We then reanalyze data (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ4,244) previously examined by Richardson et al. (Evolutionary Psychology, 15(1), 2017, https://doi.org/10.1177/1474704916666840 to determine whether (a) previously reported evidence of multidimensionality is robust to the modeling approach employed and (b) the structure of LH indicators is invariant by sex. Findings provide further evidence that a single LH dimension is implausible and that researchers should cease interpreting K-factor scores as empirical proxies for LH speed. In contrast to the original study, we detected a small inverse correlation between mating competition and Super-K that is consistent with a trade-off. Tests of measurement invariance across the sexes revealed evidence of metric invariance (i.e., equivalence of factor loadings), consistent with the theory that K is a proximate cause of its indicators; however, evidence of partial scalar invariance suggests use of scores likely introduces bias when the sexes are compared. We discuss limitations and identify approaches that researchers may use to further evaluate the validity of the K-factor and other applications of LH to human variation.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

34058399,BA-plotteR - A web tool for generating Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement.,"Investigators use Bland-Altman plot (Limits of Agreement plot) to compare two methods measuring the same continuous variable to determine interchangeability or agreement of the methods. The method has evolved to deal with heteroscedastic data and fixed or proportional biases (or both). Although an ordinary Bland-Altman plot can be readily made with various software applications, there is no free, open-source application that is dedicated to producing Bland-Altman plots and constructing limits of agreement for data that do not meet the assumptions of a simple comparison. To fill this gap, we created BA-plotteR, a web-based, open-source, freeware tool created in Shiny/R that is dedicated to creating Bland-Altman plots. We validated the tool using 20 datasets with various data distributions by comparing the output from the tool against manually derived results. The webtool handles data that requires a more complex analysis than is commonly available through commercial statistical programs. Moreover, the automated analysis of the data distribution will guide users and help them to correctly plot and analyse their data. The tool agreed perfectly with manually constructed plots.

34058973,GLEANER: a web server for GermLine cycle Expression ANalysis and Epigenetic Roadmap visualization.,"<h4>Background</h4>Germline cells are important carriers of genetic and epigenetic information transmitted across generations in mammals. During the mammalian germline cell development cycle (i.e., the germline cycle), cell potency changes cyclically, accompanied by dynamic transcriptional changes and epigenetic reprogramming. Recently, to understand these dynamic and regulatory mechanisms, multiomic analyses, including transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses of DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications of germline cells, have been performed for different stages in human and mouse germline cycles. However, the long time span of the germline cycle and material scarcity of germline cells have largely limited the understanding of these dynamic characteristic changes. A tool that integrates the existing multiomics data and visualizes the overall continuous dynamic trends in the germline cycle can partially overcome such limitations.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present GLEANER, a web server for GermLine cycle Expression ANalysis and Epigenetics Roadmap visualization. GLEANER provides a comprehensive collection of the transcriptome, DNA methylome, chromatin accessibility, and H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me3 histone modification characteristics in human and mouse germline cycles. For each input gene, GLEANER shows the integrative analysis results of its transcriptional and epigenetic features, the genes with correlated transcriptional changes, and the overall continuous dynamic trends in the germline cycle. We further used two case studies to demonstrate the detailed functionality of GLEANER and highlighted that it can provide valuable clues to the epigenetic regulation mechanisms in the genetic and epigenetic information transmitted during the germline cycle.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To the best of our knowledge, GLEANER is the first web server dedicated to the analysis and visualization of multiomics data related to the mammalian germline cycle.

The aim of this research is to assess whether the use of sedation can help improve the detection rate of UGI EC and precancerous lesions. The second objective is to evaluate its potential influencing factors.<h4>Methods</h4>The study includes 432,202 patients from a multicenter database from January 2012 to July 2019. Information on endoscopic findings and histology biopsies was obtained from endoscopy quality-control system. Associations of sedation with the detection rate of EC and precancerous lesions were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The sedation group has a higher detection rate of UGI EC and HGIN compared with the no-sedation group, whereas the detection rate of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia was similar between the 2 groups. There were more cases examined by using staining, image enhancement, or magnifying techniques in the sedation group (P < 0.001). And, the mean observation time was also longer in the sedation group (P < 0.001). The type 0-IIb esophageal HGIN and EC cases were significantly increased in the sedation group. No significant difference was detected on lesion subtypes for gastric HGIN and EC according to the Paris classification. More gastric HGIN and EC were detected at gastric body in the sedation group (P = 0.001).<h4>Discussion</h4>Sedation may improve the endoscopic detection rate of EC and HGIN in the UGI tract probably through enhancing the use of accessary endoscopic techniques, prolonging observation time, and taking more biopsies in different locations (see Visual Abstract, Supplementary Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B926).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

In a secondary analysis of randomized trial data, the authors compared the efficacy of the PREPARE for Your Care (PREPARE) website plus an easy-to-read advance directive (AD) with an AD only among older adults with and without cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Safety net, primary care patients in San Francisco were included if they were 55 years old or older, were English- or Spanish-speaking, and had 2 or more chronic conditions. The authors determined cancer diagnoses by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/Tenth Revision codes. The primary outcome was new ACP documentation in the medical record at 15 months; the secondary outcomes were self-reported ACP engagement, ease of use, satisfaction, and depression/anxiety. The authors used mixed effects logistic and linear regression adjusted for prior ACP, health literacy, and clinician, including a cancer interaction term.<h4>Results</h4>Of 986 participants, 220 (22%) had cancer. The mean age was 63 years (SD, 6 years), 61% were women, 81% were of a minority race/ethnicity, 45% were Spanish-speaking, 39% had limited health literacy, and 27% had prior ACP. New ACP documentation was higher in the PREPARE arm versus the AD-only arm among participants with cancer (62% vs 43%; P = .01) and without cancer (38% vs 28%; P = .01), as was ACP engagement in both arms (P < .001), with no interactions by cancer. Ease of use and satisfaction were high, and depression/anxiety was low, with no differences by study arm or by cancer/no cancer.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PREPARE plus an easy-to-read AD increased ACP documentation and engagement among diverse older adults with cancer more than an AD alone, with no increase in depression or anxiety between study arms or by cancer. PREPARE may help to decrease ACP disparities among patients with cancer.<h4>Lay summary</h4>Advance care planning (ACP) is the process of sharing values, goals, and preferences for medical care, but engagement in ACP is low among older adults with cancer. Among 986 English- and Spanish-speaking older adults from a safety net hospital, an interactive, multimedia, web-based ACP program (PREPARE for Your Care at https://prepareforyourcare.org/) plus an easy-to-read advance directive increased ACP documentation and engagement more than an advance directive alone. There were no differences in this increase in ACP between older adults with cancer and older adults without cancer. Also, engaging in ACP did not result in increased depression or anxiety.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

34090324,Reproducible and accessible analysis of transposon insertion sequencing in Galaxy for qualitative essentiality analyses.,"<h4>Background</h4>Significant progress has been made in advancing and standardizing tools for human genomic and biomedical research. Yet, the field of next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis for microorganisms (including multiple pathogens) remains fragmented, lacks accessible and reusable tools, is hindered by local computational resource limitations, and does not offer widely accepted standards. One such ""problem areas"" is the analysis of Transposon Insertion Sequencing (TIS) data. TIS allows probing of almost the entire genome of a microorganism by introducing random insertions of transposon-derived constructs. The impact of the insertions on the survival and growth under specific conditions provides precise information about genes affecting specific phenotypic characteristics. A wide array of tools has been developed to analyze TIS data. Among the variety of options available, it is often difficult to identify which one can provide a reliable and reproducible analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Here we sought to understand the challenges and propose reliable practices for the analysis of TIS experiments. Using data from two recent TIS studies, we have developed a series of workflows that include multiple tools for data de-multiplexing, promoter sequence identification, transposon flank alignment, and read count repartition across the genome.

34092780,"Transcultural Adaptation of Tibetan Nursing Trainees: A Case Study of ""9+3"" Vocational Technical Students in Sichuan Province, China.","BACKGROUND Nursing education is an important part of the ""9+3"" vocational education program led by Sichuan Province. In the internship stage, nursing students of Tibetan ethnicity may have problems of intercultural adaptation in the process of getting along with patients, which may affect the effective nursing outcome. The purpose of this study was to clarify the current situation of transcultural adaptation of Tibetan trainee nurses and to provide more theoretical support and guidance. MATERIAL AND METHODS We collected 237 valid survey questionnaires, based on Ward's acculturation process model, from a total of 363 Tibetan trainee nurses in the ""9+3"" free vocational education program in Chengdu, Luzhou, and Nanchong of Sichuan Province. The SPSSAU project (2020), an online application software retrieved from https://www.spssau.com, was used for data coding and archiving. RESULTS The results of questionnaire and data analysis showed that the overall level of transcultural adaptation of Tibetan trainee nurses was that the number of people with poor adaptation was slightly higher than those with good adaptation, and most Tibetan trainee nurses were in the middle level. Meanwhile, sociocultural adaptation was better than psychological adaptation. There were no statistically significant differences among the 4 grouping variables: gender, student home region, the city where the internship hospital was located, and whether they were from a single-child family or not. CONCLUSIONS The results revealed that there was still transcultural maladjustment among Tibetan nurses in the internship stage, and the psychological maladjustment was more obvious than the sociocultural maladjustment. We provide countermeasures and suggestions to solve the problems of transcultural adaptation reflected in the research.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34096110,'What matters to you?'-a qualitative study on the views of nursing home residents with dementia regarding the health care they receive.,"<h4>Aims and objective</h4>This study's aim is to examine what matters to nursing home residents with dementia by exploring their perceptions of nursing home health care through the conceptual lens of person-centred care.<h4>Background</h4>Dementia is a major contributor to nursing home placement. To understand the meaning of living with dementia, the inclusion of persons with dementia in research studies is essential.<h4>Methods</h4>In total, 35 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with people who have dementia and live in nursing homes. A thematic analysis was applied to analyse the data. Checklist for qualitative studies: Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/coreq/ RESULTS: The analysis revealed one overarching theme with four sub-themes. Different matchings of person-centred care and routines in health care being the overarching theme. The four sub-themes were as follows: (a) understanding of the interplay between disabilities and ageing; (b) participating based on one's own preferences and needs; (c) incongruence between the person with dementia's preferences and needs and health-care support; and (d) working conditions: the relationship between residents and health-care providers. Despite the substantive focus of researchers on person-centred care and the positive impact on the nursing home health care of those who receive it, the results showed that nursing home residents still want more person-centred care.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results indicate that the incongruence between general routines and individual preferences and needs, as well as the demand to operationalise the person-centred dimensions of health-care behaviour in nursing homes, must be resolved. Health care in nursing homes must focus on enabling residents to participate in daily activities and sustain their personhood and sense of self.<h4>Relevance to clinical practice</h4>Based on the residents' statements, the results contribute to the fields of dementia education, health-care provision and policy-making and may be used to achieve person-centredness and governance.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34096320,Treated HIV Infection and Progression of Carotid Atherosclerosis in Rural Uganda: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study.,"Background Although ‚âà70% of the world's population of people living with HIV reside in sub-Saharan Africa, there are minimal prospective data on the contributions of HIV infection to atherosclerosis in the region. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy >40 years of age in rural Uganda, along with population-based comparators not infected with HIV. We collected data on cardiovascular disease risk factors and carotid ultrasound measurements annually. We fitted linear mixed effects models, adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors, to estimate the association between HIV serostatus and progression of carotid intima media thickness (cIMT). We enrolled 155 people living with HIV and 154 individuals not infected with HIV and collected cIMT images at 1045 visits during a median of 4 annual visits per participant (interquartile range 3-4, range 1-5). Age (median 50.9 years) and sex (49% female) were similar by HIV serostatus. At enrollment, there was no difference in mean cIMT by HIV serostatus (0.665 versus 0.680 mm, <i>P</i>=0.15). In multivariable models, increasing age, blood pressure, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with greater cIMT (<i>P</i><0.05), however change in cIMT per year was also no different by HIV serostatus (0.004 mm/year for HIV negative [95% CI, 0.001-0.007 mm], 0.006 mm/year for people living with HIV [95% CI, 0.003-0.008 mm], HIV√ótime interaction <i>P</i>=0.25). Conclusions In rural Uganda, treated HIV infection was not associated with faster cIMT progression. These results do not support classification of treated HIV infection as a risk factor for subclinical atherosclerosis progression in rural sub-Saharan Africa.

34122055,Impact of Total Epinephrine Dose on Long Term Neurological Outcome for Cardiac Arrest Patients: A Cohort Study.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Although epinephrine is universally acknowledged to increase return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest, its balanced effects on later outcomes remain uncertain, causing potential harm during post-resuscitation phase. Recent studies have questioned the efficacy and potential deleterious effects of epinephrine on long-term survival and neurological outcomes, despite that the adverse relationship between epinephrine dose and outcome can be partially biased by longer CPR duration and underlying comorbidities. This study explored the long-term effect of epinephrine when used in a cohort of patients that underwent cardiac arrest during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. <b>Methods:</b> The data were originally collected from a retrospective institutional database from January 2007 to December 2015 and are now available on Dryad (via: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qv6fp83). Use of epinephrine was coded by dose (<2 mg, 2 mg, 3-4 mg, ‚â•5 mg). A favorable neurological outcome was defined using a Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 or 2. The association between epinephrine dosing and 3-months neurological outcome was analyzed by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated a negative association between total epinephrine dose and neurological outcome. Of the 373 eligible patients, 92 received less than 2 mg of epinephrine, 60 received 2 mg, 97 received 3-4 mg and 124 received more than 5 mg. Compared to patients who received less than 2 mg of epinephrine, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of a favorable neurological outcome was 0.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-1.68) for 2 mg of epinephrine, 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21-0.89) for 3-4 mg of epinephrine and 0.40 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.96) for more than 5 mg of epinephrine. <b>Conclusion:</b> In this cohort of patients who achieved ROSC, total epinephrine dosing during resuscitation was associated with a worse neurological outcome three months after cardiac arrest, after adjusting other confounding factors. Further researches are needed to investigate the long-term effect of epinephrine on cardiac arrest patients.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

34124628,Uncovering transmission patterns of COVID-19 outbreaks: A region-wide comprehensive retrospective study in Hong Kong.,"<h4>Background</h4>Given the dynamism and heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission patterns, determining the most effective yet timely strategies for specific regions remains a severe challenge for public health decision-makers.<h4>Methods</h4>In this work, we proposed a spatiotemporal connectivity analysis method for discovering transmission patterns across geographic locations and age-groups throughout different COVID-19 outbreak phases. First, we constructed the transmission networks of the confirmed cases during different phases by considering the spatiotemporal connectivity of any two cases. Then, for each case and those cases immediately pointed from it, we characterized the corresponding cross-district/population transmission pattern by counting their district-to-district and age-to-age occurrences. By summating the cross-district/population transmission patterns of all cases during a given period, we obtained the aggregated cross-district and cross-population transmission patterns.<h4>Findings</h4>We conducted a region-wide comprehensive retrospective study in Hong Kong based on the complete data report of COVID-19 cases, covering all 18 districts between January 23, 2020, and January 8, 2021 (https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dh-chpsebcddr-novel-infectious-agent). The spatiotemporal connectivity analysis clearly unveiled the quantitative differences among various outbreak waves in their transmission scales, durations, and patterns. Moreover, for the statistically similar waves, their cross-district/population transmission patterns could be quite different (e.g., the cross-district transmission of the fourth wave was more diverse than that of the third wave, while the transmission over age-groups of the fourth wave was more concentrated than that of the third wave). At an overall level, super-spreader individuals (highly connected cases in the transmission networks) were usually concentrated in only a few districts (2 out of 18 in our study) or age-groups (3 out of 11 in our study).<h4>Interpretation</h4>With the discovered cross-district or cross-population transmission patterns, all of the waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in Hong Kong can be systematically scrutinized. Among all districts, quite a few (e.g., the Yau Tsim Mong district) were instrumental in spreading the virus throughout the pandemic. Aside from being exceptionally densely populated, these districts were also social-economic centers. With a variety of situated public venues, such as restaurants and singing/dancing clubs, these districts played host to all kinds of social gathering events, thereby providing opportunities for widespread and rapid transmission of the virus. Thus, these districts should be given the highest priority when deploying district-specific social distancing or intervention strategies, such as lockdown and stringent mandatory coronavirus testing for identifying and obstructing the chain of transmission. We also observed that most of the reported cases and the highly connected cases were middle-aged and elderly people (40- to 69-year-olds). People in these age-groups were active in various public places and social activities, and thus had high chances of being infected by or infecting others.<h4>Funding</h4>General research fund of the Hong Kong research grants council.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34126844,Incidence and prevalence of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (functional seizures): a systematic review and an analytical study.,"<h4>Aim</h4>Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) or functional seizures are universal phenomena. However, data on their epidemiology is limited. The aim of the current study was to review the literature on the epidemiology of PNES and to provide analytical estimates of its incidence and prevalence based on the direct data that are available from previous studies on PNES.<h4>Methods</h4>The methods of this work had two parts: (1) MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Scopus from inception to 19 October 2019 were systematically searched. (2) The analytical study of the incidence and prevalence of PNES was performed, based on the following data from previous studies: incidence of PNES, duration of PNES before making a diagnosis, outcome and mortality of PNES.<h4>Results</h4>The search strategy yielded five articles; three were on the incidence and two on the prevalence. In the analytical part of the study, the incidence of PNES was calculated to be 3.1 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.1-5.1) per 100,000 population per year. The calculated prevalence rate of PNES in 2019 was 108.5 (95% Confidence Interval: 39.2-177.8) per 100,000 population, in the USA.<h4>Conclusion</h4>While, the generalizability of these calculated incidence and prevalence rates to other places in the world is limited, they give us a reasonable hint that PNES is a common condition and the prevalence is much more than that it was thought before.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1942870.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

34142845,"First report of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris as the causal agent of necrotic leaf spot in Phaseolus vulgaris at Puebla, Mexico.","Beans are the most cultivated legume in the world. In Mexico, it is the second most important crop after corn (FAO 2020; SIAP 2020). Bean plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety were affected by a foliar disease during the agricultural cycle 2019 in Puebla-Mexico (19¬∞02'46.6"" LN and 98¬∞05'15.6"" LO). Necrotic V- shaped lesions were observed on the margins of the leaves surrounded by yellow halos followed by foliar necrosis, affecting 40% of the crop. In Mexico this variety of cultivars is in great demand for local consumption and generates income in foreign currency (Castellanos et al. 1997). Sampling was carried out on 50 plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety, with necrotic leaf symptoms from ten plots of one hectare. Samples were cut into pieces (5 mm), disinfested with 1% hypochlorite 3 min, and washed with sterile distilled water. Subsequently, samples were dried on sterile paper and placed on Petri plates containing yeast extract calcium carbonate dextrose agar (YDC) medium and kept at 36¬∞C for 3 days. Colonies of ten typical bacteria isolated from all symptomatic plants were Gram (-), small and uniform in size with rounded edges, yellow, convex with entire borders and mucoid appearance on YDC. Bacteria did not grow on 0.1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride amended casamino acid, peptone, and glucose medium (CPG). Biochemical tests showed that isolates did not reduce nitrate to nitrites, had positive catalase and starch hydrolysis, while the Kovac oxidase test was negative (Schaad and White 1974). Genus identity of the representative isolate Xcf1-APJR, was confirmed by 16S rRNA encoding gene partial sequencing, using universal primers 518F (5'-CCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACG-3') and 800R (5'-TACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3') (Halim et al. 2020). BLASTn alignments against the nucleotide collection were 100% identical to Xanthomonas sequences including Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris strains NZ_AP019684.1, CP025750.1, and MN108237.1. The 1,418 bp sequence was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number MT645246. The identification of species/pathovar was accomplished by serological methods using a polyclonal antiserum specific for X. campestris pv. campestris (Popovic ÃÅ et al. 2013) with the DAS-ELISA commercial kit (catalog number 07122C/096, LOEWE Biochemica GmbH, Germany). The pathogenicity test was carried out on 50 healthy bean plants from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety. Bacterial culture incubated at 28¬∞C for 48 h in YDC medium was used to prepare the bacterial suspension (108 CFU mL-1). The first two lower leaves of 30-day-old plants were inoculated by sprinkling. Ten plants sprayed with sterile distilled water were used as negative control. All plants were kept for 20 days in greenhouse at 18-26¬∞C and relative humidity of 60%. After seven days, chlorotic lesions developed on all inoculated plants that became necrotic from 14 days after inoculation (dai). Necrotic leaf spots merged at 14 dai to form necrotic areas of more than 20 mm in diameter, reaching total necrosis of the leaf tissue at 20 dai and were similar to the symptoms observed in the field. Koch's postulates were confirmed by the reisolation of Xcf1-APJR strain, which presented the same colony morphology, partial sequence, and polyclonal specific detection. This is the first report of this pathogen causing necrotic leaf spot in beans from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety in Puebla-Mexico. The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.

34153027,pyTFM: A tool for traction force and monolayer stress microscopy.,"Cellular force generation and force transmission are of fundamental importance for numerous biological processes and can be studied with the methods of Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) and Monolayer Stress Microscopy. Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy solve the inverse problem of reconstructing cell-matrix tractions and inter- and intra-cellular stresses from the measured cell force-induced deformations of an adhesive substrate with known elasticity. Although several laboratories have developed software for Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy computations, there is currently no software package available that allows non-expert users to perform a full evaluation of such experiments. Here we present pyTFM, a tool to perform Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy on cell patches and cell layers grown in a 2-dimensional environment. pyTFM was optimized for ease-of-use; it is open-source and well documented (hosted at https://pytfm.readthedocs.io/) including usage examples and explanations of the theoretical background. pyTFM can be used as a standalone Python package or as an add-on to the image annotation tool ClickPoints. In combination with the ClickPoints environment, pyTFM allows the user to set all necessary analysis parameters, select regions of interest, examine the input data and intermediary results, and calculate a wide range of parameters describing forces, stresses, and their distribution. In this work, we also thoroughly analyze the accuracy and performance of the Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy algorithms of pyTFM using synthetic and experimental data from epithelial cell patches.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

The patients were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set. The X-tile analysis provides the best age and tumor size cut-off point, and changes continuous variables into categorical variables. The independent prognostic factors were determined by Cox regression analysis, and 2 nomograms were established. Receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration curves were used to evaluate the nomograms. Based on the nomograms, 2 web-based nomograms were established.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred and twenty-eight cases were included in the OS nomogram construction, and were randomly divided into a training set (n=160) and a validation set (n=68). Age, T stage, bone metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy, marital status, tumor size, and tumor site were found to be correlated with OS. One hundred and eighty-three cases were enrolled in the CSS nomogram construction, and randomly divided into a training set (n=129) and a validation set (n=54). Age, bone metastasis, surgery, chemotherapy, tumor size, and tumor site were found to be correlated with CSS. Two nomograms were established to predict OS and CSS. In the training set, the areas under the curve of the nomogram for predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS were 0.783, 0.830, and 0.832, respectively, and those for predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year CSS were 0.889, 0.777, and 0.884, respectively. Two web-based nomograms were established to predict OS (https://wenn23.shinyapps.io/lmslmosapp/), and CSS (https://wenn23.shinyapps.io/lmslmcssapp/).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The developed web-based nomogram is a useful tool for accurately analyzing the prognosis of LMS patients with lung metastasis, and could help clinical doctors to make personalized clinical decisions.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34165340,Application of Text Mining in Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures: A Case Study of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs).,"<h4>Background</h4>Cancer risk assessment of complex exposures, such as exposure to mixtures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is challenging due to the diverse biological activities of these compounds. With the help of text mining (TM), we have developed TM tools-the latest iteration of the Cancer Risk Assessment using Biomedical literature tool (CRAB3) and a Cancer Hallmarks Analytics Tool (CHAT)-that could be useful for automatic literature analyses in cancer risk assessment and research. Although CRAB3 analyses are based on carcinogenic modes of action (MOAs) and cover almost all the key characteristics of carcinogens, CHAT evaluates literature according to the hallmarks of cancer referring to the alterations in cellular behavior that characterize the cancer cell.<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective was to evaluate the usefulness of these tools to support cancer risk assessment by performing a case study of 22 European Union and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs and diesel exhaust and a case study of PAH interactions with silica.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed PubMed literature, comprising 57,498 references concerning priority PAHs and complex PAH mixtures, using CRAB3 and CHAT.<h4>Results</h4>CRAB3 analyses correctly identified similarities and differences in genotoxic and nongenotoxic MOAs of the 22 priority PAHs and grouped them according to their known carcinogenic potential. CHAT had the same capacity and complemented the CRAB output when comparing, for example, benzo[<i>a</i>]pyrene and dibenzo[<i>a,l</i>]pyrene. Both CRAB3 and CHAT analyses highlighted potentially interacting mechanisms within and across complex PAH mixtures and mechanisms of possible importance for interactions with silica.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These data suggest that our TM approach can be useful in the hazard identification of PAHs and mixtures including PAHs. The tools can assist in grouping chemicals and identifying similarities and differences in carcinogenic MOAs and their interactions. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6702.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

To elucidate potential SNP markers obtained by NGS, we used a complete set of A. fistulosum L.-A. cepa monosomic addition lines (MALs) and doubled haploids (DHs). These were the parental lines of an A. cepa mapping population for transcriptome-based SNP genotyping.<h4>Results</h4>We mapped the transcriptome sequence reads from a series of A. fistulosum-A. cepa MALs onto the unigene sequence of the doubled haploid shallot A. cepa Aggregatum group (DHA) and compared the MAL genotype call for parental bunching onion and shallot transcriptome mapping data. We identified SNP sites with at least four reads on 25,462 unigenes. They were anchored on eight A. cepa chromosomes. A single SNP site was identified on 3,278 unigenes and multiple SNPs were identified on 22,184 unigenes. The chromosome marker information was made public via the web database Allium TDB ( http://alliumtdb.kazusa.or.jp/ ). To apply transcriptome based genotyping approach for genetic mapping, we gathered RNA sequence data from 96 lines of a DHA √ó doubled haploid bulb onion A. cepa common onion group (DHC) mapping population. After selecting co-dominant SNP sites, 16,872 SNPs were identified in 5,339 unigenes. Of these, at least two SNPs with identical genotypes were found in 1,435 unigenes. We developed a linkage map using genotype information from these unigenes. All unigene markers mapped onto the eight chromosomes and graphical genotyping was conducted based on the unigene order information. Another 2,963 unigenes were allocated onto the eight chromosomes. To confirm the accuracy of this transcriptome-based genetic linkage map, conventional PCR-based markers were used for linkage analysis. All SNP - and PCR-based markers were mapped onto the expected linkage groups and no inconsistency was found among these chromosomal locations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Effective transcriptome analysis with unique Allium resources successfully associated numerous chromosome markers with unigene information and a high-density A. cepa linkage map. The information on these unigene markers is valuable in genome sequencing and useful trait detection in Allium.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,references other db,not descriptive of resource
34175254,Robot-assisted Versus Open Radical Cystectomy in Bladder Cancer: An Economic Evaluation Alongside a Multicentre Comparative Effectiveness Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Open radical cystectomy (ORC) is regarded as the standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, but robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) is increasingly used in practice. A recent study showed that RARC resulted in slightly fewer minor but slightly more major complications, although the difference was not statistically significant. Some differences were found in secondary outcomes favouring either RARC or ORC. RARC use is expected to increase in coming years, which fuels the debate about whether RARC provides value for money.<h4>Objective</h4>To assess the cost-effectiveness of RARC compared to ORC in bladder cancer.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This economic evaluation was performed alongside a prospective multicentre comparative effectiveness study. We included 348 bladder cancer patients (ORC, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ168; RARC, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ180) from 19 Dutch hospitals.<h4>Outcome measurements and statistical analysis</h4>Over 1 yr, we assessed the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from both healthcare and societal perspectives. We used single imputation nested in the bootstrap percentile method to assess missing data and uncertainty, and inverse probability of treatment weighting to control for potential bias. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the impact of various parameters on the cost difference.<h4>Results and limitations</h4>The mean healthcare cost per patient was ‚Ç¨17‚Äâ141 (95% confidence interval [CI] ‚Ç¨15‚Äâ791-‚Ç¨18‚Äâ720) for ORC and ‚Ç¨21‚Äâ266 (95% CI ‚Ç¨19‚Äâ163-‚Ç¨23 650) for RARC. The mean societal cost per patient was ‚Ç¨18‚Äâ926 (95% CI ‚Ç¨17‚Äâ431-‚Ç¨22‚Äâ642) for ORC and ‚Ç¨24‚Äâ896 (95% CI ‚Ç¨21‚Äâ925-‚Ç¨31‚Äâ888) for RARC. On average, RARC patients gained 0.79 QALYs (95% CI 0.74-0.85) compared to 0.81 QALYs (95% CI 0.77-0.85) for ORC patients, resulting in a mean QALY difference of -0.02 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.02). Using a cost-effectiveness threshold of ‚Ç¨80‚Äâ000, RARC was cost-effective in 0.6% and 0.2% of the replications for the healthcare and societal perspectives, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>RARC shows no difference in terms of QALYs, but is more expensive than ORC. Hence, RARC does not seem to provide value for money in comparison to ORC.<h4>Patient summary</h4>This study assessed the relation between costs and effects of robot-assisted surgery compared to open surgery for removal of the bladder in 348 Dutch patients with bladder cancer. We found that after 1 year, the two approaches were similarly effective according to a measure called quality-adjusted life years, but robot-assisted surgery was much more expensive.

34179956,The DNA methylation haplotype (mHap) format and mHapTools.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) is currently the gold standard for measuring genome-wide DNA methylation profiles at single-nucleotide resolution. Most analyses focus on mean CpG methylation and ignore methylation states on the same DNA fragments [DNA methylation haplotypes (mHaps)]. Here, we propose mHap, a simple DNA mHap format for storing DNA BS-seq data. This format reduces the size of a BAM file by 40- to 140-fold while retaining complete read-level CpG methylation information. It is also compatible with the Tabix tool for fast and random access. We implemented a command-line tool, mHapTools, for converting BAM/SAM files from existing platforms to mHap files as well as post-processing DNA methylation data in mHap format. With this tool, we processed all publicly available human reduced representation bisulfite sequencing data and provided these data as a comprehensive mHap database.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://jiantaoshi.github.io/mHap/index.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,"database of reformatted previous data; reassessed, the data are fine, resource is not since githubio","no notes; reassessed and no still - in github.io, format, tool, not a data resource in and of itself"
34180600,Primary antibiotic resistance of Helicobacter pylori isolates is twofold more frequent in HIV-positive than HIV-negative individuals: A descriptive observational study.,"The antimicrobial susceptibility of Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from HIV-positive individuals is not well characterized. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and long-term trends associated with primary H. pylori antibiotic resistance, evaluate correlations with antibiotic consumption, and compare predictors for H. pylori antibiotic resistance between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. In this longitudinal registry study, we evaluated consecutive adults with and without HIV infection, na√Øve to H. pylori treatment, who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and had a positive H. pylori culture, with susceptibility testing available, between 2004 and 2015. Outpatient antibiotic consumption data were based on nationwide aggregated numbers. H. pylori was isolated from gastric biopsies of 3008/8321 patients, 181/477 (37.9%) were HIV-positive and 2827/7844 (36.0%) HIV-negative. Overall cohort mean prevalence of H. pylori primary antibiotic resistance was 11.1% for clarithromycin, 17.8% levofloxacin, and 39.4% metronidazole. The prevalence of H. pylori primary resistance was significantly higher for these three drugs in HIV-positive individuals across the study period. Linear regression showed that the prevalence of clarithromycin and levofloxacin resistance correlated with the country aggregate daily dose consumption of macrolides and quinolones, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that HIV infection is a strong independent risk factor for multiple H. pylori antibiotic resistance. In summary, HIV infection is a risk factor for carrying multi-resistant H. pylori strains and this is correlated with antibiotic consumption. Empirical therapies should be avoided in HIV-positive individuals. These data highlight the need to implement ongoing monitoring of H. pylori antimicrobial susceptibility among HIV-positive individuals.

34188160,NOD: a web server to predict New use of Old Drugs to facilitate drug repurposing.,"Computational methods accelerate the drug repurposing pipelines that are a quicker and cost-effective alternative to discovering new molecules. However, there is a paucity of web servers to conduct fast, focussed, and customized investigations for identifying new uses of old drugs. We present the NOD web server, which has the mentioned characteristics. NOD uses a sensitive sequence-guided approach to identify close and distant homologs of a protein of interest. NOD then exploits this evolutionary information to suggest potential compounds from the DrugBank database that can be repurposed against the input protein. NOD also allows expansion of the chemical space of the potential candidates through similarity searches. We have validated the performance of NOD against available experimental and/or clinical reports. In 65.6% of the investigated cases in a control study, NOD is able to identify drugs more effectively than the searches made in DrugBank.

Median follow-up was 31 months. Superior rectal artery ligation was associated with a similar anastomotic leak rate compared to inferior mesenteric artery ligation (9vs8%, p=1.0). Median number of lymph nodes removed was identical (15vs15, p=0.38). On multivariable analysis accounting for relevant clinicopathologic factors, superior rectal artery ligation was not associated with increased anastomotic leak rate, worse lymph node harvest, or worse locoregional recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival, or overall survival (all p>0.1).<h4>Limitations</h4>This was a retrospective design.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared to inferior mesenteric artery ligation, superior rectal artery ligation is not associated with either worse technical or oncologic outcomes. Given the potential risks of inadequate blood flow to the proximal limb of the anastomosis and autonomic nerve injury, we advocate for increased utilization of superior rectal artery ligation.

Both deep learning and classical algorithms have their merits for drug design. Here, the webserver WADDAICA is built to employ the advantage of deep learning model and classical algorithms for drug design. The WADDAICA mainly contains two modules. In the first module, WADDAICA provides deep learning models for scaffold hopping of compounds to modify or design new novel drugs. The deep learning model which is used in WADDAICA shows a good scoring power based on the PDBbind database. In the second module, WADDAICA supplies functions for modifying or designing new novel drugs by classical algorithms. WADDAICA shows better Pearson and Spearman correlations of binding affinity than Autodock Vina that is considered to have the best scoring power. Besides, WADDAICA supplies a friendly and convenient web interface for users to submit drug design jobs. We believe that WADDAICA is a useful and effective tool to help researchers to modify or design novel drugs by deep learning models and classical algorithms.

34196957,elaborator: A Novel App for Insights into Laboratory Data of Clinical Trials.,"In clinical studies there are huge numbers of laboratory parameters available that are measured at several visits for several treatment groups. The status quo for presenting laboratory data in clinical trials consists in generating large numbers of tables and data listings. Such tables and listings are required for submissions to health authorities. However, reviewing laboratory data presented in the form of tables and listings is a lengthy and tedious process. Thus, to enable efficient exploration of laboratory data we developed elaborator, a comprehensive and easy-to-use interactive browser-based application. The elaborator app comprises three analyses types for addressing different questions, for example about changes in laboratory values that frequently occur, treatment-related changes and changes beyond the normal ranges. In this way, the app can be used by study teams for identifying safety signals in a clinical trial as well as for generating hypotheses that are further inspected with detailed analyses and possibly data from other sources. The elaborator app is implemented in the statistical software R. The R package elaborator can be obtained from https://cran.r-project.org/package=elaborator . Patients' laboratory data need to be extracted from the clinical database and pre-processed locally for feeding into the app. For exploring data by means of the elaborator, the user needs some familiarity with R but no programming knowledge is required.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
34210730,Health literacy among pregnant women in a lifestyle intervention trial: protocol for an explorative study on the role of health literacy in the perinatal health service setting.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Pregnancy is a vulnerable period that affects long-term health of pregnant women and their unborn infants. Health literacy plays a crucial role in promoting healthy behaviour and thereby maintaining good health. This study explores the role of health literacy in the GeMuKi (acronym for 'Gemeinsam Gesund: Vorsorge plus f√ºr Mutter und Kind'-Strengthening health promotion: enhanced check-up visits for mother and child) Project. It will assess the ability of the GeMuKi lifestyle intervention to positively affect health literacy levels through active participation in preventive counselling. The study also explores associations between health literacy, health outcomes, health service use and effectiveness of the intervention.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>The GeMuKi trial has a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design and is carried out in routine prenatal health service settings in Germany. Women (n=1860) are recruited by their gynaecologist during routine check-up visits before 12 weeks of gestation. Trained healthcare providers carry out counselling using motivational interviewing techniques to positively affect health literacy and lifestyle-related risk factors. Healthcare providers (gynaecologists and midwives) and women jointly agree on Specific, Measurable, Achievable Reasonable, Time-Bound goals. Women will be invited to fill in questionnaires at two time points (at recruitment and 37th-40th week of gestation) using an app. Health literacy is measured using the German version of the Health Literacy Survey-16 and the Brief Health Literacy Screener. Lifestyle is measured with questions on physical activity, nutrition, alcohol and drug use. Health outcomes of both mother and child, including gestational weight gain (GWG) will be documented at each routine visit. Health service use will be assessed using social health insurance claims data. Data analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 26.0. These include descriptive statistics, tests and regression models. A mediation model will be conducted to answer the question whether health behaviour mediates the association between health literacy and GWG.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>The study was approved by the University Hospital of Cologne Research Ethics Committee (ID: 18-163) and the State Chamber of Physicians in Baden-Wuerttemberg (ID: B-F-2018-100).

34213323,pdCSM-cancer: Using Graph-Based Signatures to Identify Small Molecules with Anticancer Properties.,"The development of new, effective, and safe drugs to treat cancer remains a challenging and time-consuming task due to limited hit rates, restraining subsequent development efforts. Despite the impressive progress of quantitative structure-activity relationship and machine learning-based models that have been developed to predict molecule pharmacodynamics and bioactivity, they have had mixed success at identifying compounds with anticancer properties against multiple cell lines. Here, we have developed a novel predictive tool, pdCSM-cancer, which uses a graph-based signature representation of the chemical structure of a small molecule in order to accurately predict molecules likely to be active against one or multiple cancer cell lines. pdCSM-cancer represents the most comprehensive anticancer bioactivity prediction platform developed till date, comprising trained and validated models on experimental data of the growth inhibition concentration (GI50%) effects, including over 18,000 compounds, on 9 tumor types and 74 distinct cancer cell lines. Across 10-fold cross-validation, it achieved Pearson's correlation coefficients of up to 0.74 and comparable performance of up to 0.67 across independent, non-redundant blind tests. Leveraging the insights from these cell line-specific models, we developed a generic predictive model to identify molecules active in at least 60 cell lines. Our final model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of up to 0.94 on 10-fold cross-validation and up to 0.94 on independent non-redundant blind tests, outperforming alternative approaches. We believe that our predictive tool will provide a valuable resource to optimizing and enriching screening libraries for the identification of effective and safe anticancer molecules. To provide a simple and integrated platform to rapidly screen for potential biologically active molecules with favorable anticancer properties, we made pdCSM-cancer freely available online at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/pdcsm_cancer.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,data to train and test and the models

Factors included in the model were determined by univariate and multiple Cox proportional hazard analyses based on the training set.<h4>Results</h4>Independent prognostic factors including etiology, hemoglobin level, creatinine level, proteinuria, and urinary protein/creatinine ratio were determined and contained in the model. The model showed good calibration and discrimination. The area under the curve (AUC) values generated to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year progression-free survival in the training set were 0.947, 0.931, and 0.939, respectively. In the validation set, the model still revealed excellent calibration and discrimination, and the AUC values generated to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year progression-free survival were 0.948, 0.933, and 0.915, respectively. In addition, decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model was clinically beneficial. Moreover, to visualize the prediction results, we established a web-based calculator ( https://ncutool.shinyapps.io/CKDprogression/ ).<h4>Conclusion</h4>An easy-to-operate model based on five relevant factors was developed and validated as a conventional tool to assist doctors with clinical decision-making and personalized treatment.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

We describe here the establishment of a cyanobacterial culture collection (CC) and present the first version of the strain catalog and its online database (http://lege.ciimar.up.pt/). The LEGE CC holds 386 strains, mainly collected in coastal (48%), estuarine (11%), and fresh (34%) water bodies, for the most part from Portugal (84%). By following the most recent taxonomic classification, LEGE CC strains were classified into at least 46 genera from six orders (41% belong to the Synechococcales), several of them are unique among the phylogenetic diversity of the cyanobacteria. For all strains, primary data were obtained and secondary data were surveyed and reviewed, which can be reached through the strain sheets either in the catalog or in the online database. An overview on the notable biodiversity of LEGE CC strains is showcased, including a searchable phylogenetic tree and images for all strains. With this work, 80% of the LEGE CC strains have now their 16S rRNA gene sequences deposited in GenBank. Also, based in primary data, it is demonstrated that several LEGE CC strains are a promising source of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Through a review of previously published data, it is exposed that LEGE CC strains have the potential or actual capacity to produce a variety of biotechnologically interesting compounds, including common cyanotoxins or unprecedented bioactive molecules. Phylogenetic diversity of LEGE CC strains does not entirely reflect chemodiversity. Further bioprospecting should, therefore, account for strain specificity of the valuable cyanobacterial holdings of LEGE CC.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource

A commonly used approach to select candidate disease-causing variants is to test whether the associated gene has been previously reported to be disease-causing. In the absence of known disease-causing genes, it can be challenging to associate candidate genes with specific genetic diseases. To facilitate the discovery of novel gene-disease associations, we determined the putative biologically closest known genes and their associated diseases for 13,005 human genes not currently reported to be disease-associated. We used these data to construct the closest disease-causing genes (CDG) server, which can be used to infer the closest genes with an associated disease for a user-defined list of genes or diseases. We demonstrate the utility of the CDG server in five immunodeficiency patient exomes across different diseases and modes of inheritance, where CDG dramatically reduced the number of candidate genes to be evaluated. This resource will be a considerable asset for ascertaining the potential relevance of genetic variants found in patient exomes to specific diseases of interest.

30715167,The global dissemination of bacterial infections necessitates the study of reverse genomic epidemiology.,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized the genotyping of bacterial pathogens and is expected to become the new gold standard for tracing the transmissions of bacterial infectious diseases for public health purposes. Traditional genomic epidemiology often uses WGS as a verification tool, namely, when a common source or epidemiological link is suspected, the collected isolates are sequenced for the determination of clonal relationships. However, increasingly frequent international travel and food transportation, and the associated potential for the cross-border transmission of bacterial pathogens, often lead to an absence of information on bacterial transmission routes. Here we introduce the concept of 'reverse genomic epidemiology', i.e. when isolates are inspected by genome comparisons to be sufficiently similar to one another, they are assumed to be a consequence of infection from a common source. Through BacWGSTdb (http://bacdb.org/BacWGSTdb/), a database we have developed for bacterial genome typing and source tracking, we have found that almost the entire analyzed 20 bacterial species exhibit the phenomenon of cross-border clonal dissemination. Five networks were further identified in which isolates sharing nearly identical genomes were collected from at least five different countries. Three of these have been documented as real infectious disease outbreaks, therefore demonstrating the feasibility and authority of reverse genomic epidemiology. Our survey and proposed strategy would be of potential value in establishing a global surveillance system for tracing bacterial transmissions and outbreaks; the related database and techniques require urgent standardization.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,an update on the usefulness of their data resource,

31197322,MetOSite: an integrated resource for the study of methionine residues sulfoxidation.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The oxidation of protein-bound methionine to form methionine sulfoxide has traditionally been regarded as an oxidative damage. However, growing evidences support the view of this reversible reaction also as a regulatory post-translational modification. Thus, the oxidation of methionine residues has been reported to have multiple and varied implications for protein function. However, despite the importance of this modification and the abundance of reports, all these data are scattered in the literature. No database/resource on methionine sulfoxidation exists currently. Since this information is useful to gain further insights into the redox regulation of cellular proteins, we have created a primary database of experimentally confirmed sulfoxidation sites.<h4>Results</h4>MetOSite currently contains 7242 methionine sulfoxide sites found in 3562 different proteins from 23 species, with Homo sapiens, Arabidopsis thaliana and Bacillus cereus as the main contributors. Each collected site has been classified according to the effect of its sulfoxidation on the biological properties of the modified protein. Thus, MetOSite documents cases where the sulfoxidation of methionine leads to (i) gain of activity, (ii) loss of activity, (iii) increased protein-protein interaction susceptibility, (iv) decreased protein-protein interaction susceptibility, (v) changes in protein stability and (vi) changes in subcellular location.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MetOSite is available at https://metosite.uma.es.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Here, we present BBCancer (http://bbcancer.renlab.org/), a web-accessible and comprehensive open resource for providing the expression landscape of six types of RNAs, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), tRNA-derived fragments (tRFRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in blood samples, including plasma, CTCs and EVs, from cancer patients with various cancer types. Currently, BBCancer contains expression data of the six RNA types from 5040 normal and tumor blood samples across 15 cancer types. We believe this database will serve as a powerful platform for developing blood biomarkers.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

31942979,Phenotype-genotype network construction and characterization: a case study of cardiovascular diseases and associated non-coding RNAs.,"The phenotype-genotype relationship is a key for personalized and precision medicine for complex diseases. To unravel the complexity of the clinical phenotype-genotype network, we used cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and associated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) (i.e. miRNAs, long ncRNAs, etc.) as the case for the study of CVDs at a systems or network level. We first integrated a database of CVDs and ncRNAs (CVDncR, http://sysbio.org.cn/cvdncr/) to construct CVD-ncRNA networks and annotate their clinical associations. To characterize the networks, we then separated the miRNAs into two groups, i.e. universal miRNAs associated with at least two types of CVDs and specific miRNAs related only to one type of CVD. Our analyses indicated two interesting patterns in these CVD-ncRNA networks. First, scale-free features were present within both CVD-miRNA and CVD-lncRNA networks; second, universal miRNAs were more likely to be CVDs biomarkers. These results were confirmed by computational functional analyses. The findings offer theoretical guidance for decoding CVD-ncRNA associations and will facilitate the screening of CVD ncRNA biomarkers.

This species enjoys the availability of a wide range of research tools, well-annotated reference databases and highly similar gene circuitry to other insects. To facilitate molecular mechanism studies in Drosophila, we present the Predicted Drosophila Interactome Resource (PDIR), a database of high-quality predicted functional gene interactions. These interactions were inferred from evidence in 10 public databases providing information for functional gene interactions from diverse perspectives. The current version of PDIR includes 102‚Äâ835 putative functional associations with balanced sensitivity and specificity, which are expected to cover 22.56% of all Drosophila protein interactions. This set of functional interactions is a good reference for hypothesis formulation in molecular mechanism studies. At the same time, these interactions also serve as a high-quality reference interactome for gene set linkage analysis (GSLA), which is a web tool for the interpretation of the potential functional impacts of a set of changed genes observed in transcriptomics analyses. In a case study, we show that the PDIR/GSLA system was able to produce a more comprehensive and concise interpretation of the collective functional impact of multiple simultaneously changed genes compared with the widely used gene set annotation tools, including PANTHER and David. PDIR and its associated GSLA service can be accessed at http://drosophila.biomedtzc.cn.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
32117995,Nc2Eye: A Curated ncRNAomics Knowledgebase for Bridging Basic and Clinical Research in Eye Diseases.,"Eye diseases (EDs) represent a group of disorders affecting the visual system, most of which can lead to visual impairment and blindness. Accumulating evidence reveals that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are closely associated with a wide variety of EDs. However, abundant associations between ncRNAs and EDs are scattered across the published literature, obstructing a global view of ncRNA-ED associations. A public resource of high-quality manually curated ncRNAomics knowledge associated with EDs remains unavailable. To address this gap, we thus developed Nc2Eye (http://nc2eye.bio-data.cn/), which is the first knowledgebase dedicated to providing a comprehensive ncRNAomics resource for bridging basic and clinical research in EDs. Through a comprehensive review of more than 2400 published papers, Nc2Eye catalogs 7088 manually curated ncRNA-ED associations involving 4363 ncRNAs across eight species. We also provide detailed descriptions and annotation information for each ncRNA-disease association such as ncRNA categories, experimental methods, expression pattern and related clinical drugs. To further expand the pathogenic ncRNAs, we also collected more than 90 high-throughput EDs-related transcriptome datasets. Furthermore, a user-friendly interface was constructed for convenient and flexible data browsing, querying, and retrieving. We believe that Nc2Eye is a timely and valuable knowledgebase for significantly improving and useful for discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Factors influencing the stability of MPs differ from globular proteins due to the presence of membrane spanning regions. Thermodynamic data of MPs aid to understand the relationship among their structure, stability and function. Although a wealth of experimental data on thermodynamics of MPs are reported in the literature, there is no database available explicitly for MPs. In this work, we have developed a database for MP thermodynamics, MPTherm, which contains more than 7000 thermodynamic data from about 320 MPs. Each entry contains protein sequence and structural information, membrane topology, experimental conditions, thermodynamic parameters such as melting temperature, free energy, enthalpy etc. and literature information. MPTherm assists users to retrieve the data by using different search and display options. We have also provided the sequence and structure visualization as well as cross-links to UniProt and PDB databases. MPTherm database is freely available at http://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/mptherm/. It is implemented in HTML, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript, and supports the latest versions of major browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome and Opera.

Gene and protein regulatory networks are subsequently being derived based on these proteogenomic profiles, which serve as tools to gain systems-level understanding of the molecular regulatory factories underlying these diseases. On the other hand, it remains a challenge to effectively visualize and navigate the resulting network models, which capture higher order structures in the proteogenomic profiles. There is a pressing need to have a new open community resource tool for intuitive visual exploration, interpretation, and communication of these gene/protein regulatory networks by the cancer research community. In this work, ProNetView-ccRCC (http://ccrcc.cptac-network-view.org/), an interactive web-based network exploration portal for investigating phosphopeptide co-expression network inferred based on the CPTAC clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) phosphoproteomics data is introduced. ProNetView-ccRCC enables quick, user-intuitive visual interactions with the ccRCC tumor phosphoprotein co-expression network comprised of 3614 genes, as well as 30 functional pathway-enriched network modules.

However, it is inconvenient for scientists to query and retrieve published data; thus, a comprehensive resource for the quantitative gut metagenome is urgently needed. In this study, we developed gut MEtaGenome Atlas (gutMEGA), a well-annotated comprehensive database, to curate and host published quantitative gut microbiota datasets from Homo sapiens. By carefully curating the gut microbiota composition, phenotypes and experimental information, gutMEGA finally integrated 59 132 quantification events for 6457 taxa at seven different levels (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) under 776 conditions. Moreover, with various browsing and search functions, gutMEGA provides a fast and simple way for users to obtain the relative abundances of intestinal microbes among phenotypes.

Hence, we have developed the DenvInD database for experimentally validated DENV inhibitors against its known targets presently hosted at https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/denvind/. This database provides comprehensive information, i.e. PubChem IDs, SMILES, IC50, EC50, CC50, and wherever available Ki values of the 484 compounds in vitro validated as inhibitors against respective drug targets of DENV. Also, the DenvInD database has been linked to the user-friendly web-based interface and accessibility features, such as simple search, advanced search and data browsing. All the required data curation was conducted manually from the reported scientific literature and PubChem. The collected information was then organized into the DenvInD database using sequence query language under user interface by hypertext markup language. DenvInD is the first useful repository of its kind which would augment the DENV drug discovery research by providing essential information on known DENV inhibitors for molecular docking, computational screening, pharmacophore modeling and quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

It is a diploid (2n‚Äâ=‚Äâ14) outbreeding species that belongs to the genus Festuca. Together with Lolium perenne, they are the most important genera of forage grasses. Meadow fescue has very high quality of yield with good winter survival and persistency. However, extensive genomic resources for meadow fescue have not become available so far. To address this lack of comprehensive publicly available datasets, we have developed functionally annotated draft genome sequences of two meadow fescue genotypes, 'HF7/2' and 'B14/16', and constructed the platform ForageGrassBase, available at http://foragegrass.org/, for data visualization, download and querying. This is the first open-access platform that provides extensive genomic resources related to this forage grass species. The current database provides the most up-to-date draft genome sequence along with structural and functional annotations for genes that can be accessed using Genome Browser (GBrowse), along with comparative genomic alignments to Arabidopsis, L. perenne, barley, rice, Brachypodium and maize genomes. We have integrated homologous search tool BLAST also for the users to analyze their data. Combined, GBrowse, BLAST and downloadable data gives a user-friendly access to meadow fescue genomic resources. To our knowledge, ForageGrassBase is the first genome database dedicated to forage grasses.

Drug-drug similarity has been derived by variety of direct and indirect sources of evidence and frequently shown high predictive power in discovering validated repositioning candidates as well as other in-silico drug development applications. Yet, existing resources either have limited coverage or rely on an individual source of evidence, overlooking the wealth and diversity of drug-related data sources. Hence, there has been an unmet need for a comprehensive resource integrating diverse drug-related information to derive multi-evidenced drug-drug similarities. We addressed this resource gap by compiling heterogenous information for an exhaustive set of small-molecule drugs (total of 10 367 in the current version) and systematically integrated multiple sources of evidence to derive a multi-modal drug-drug similarity network. The resulting database, 'DrugSimDB' currently includes 238 635 drug pairs with significant aggregated similarity, complemented with an interactive user-friendly web interface (http://vafaeelab.com/drugSimDB.html), which not only enables database ease of access, search, filtration and export, but also provides a variety of complementary information on queried drugs and interactions. The integration approach can flexibly incorporate further drug information into the similarity network, providing an easily extendable platform.

In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the availability of the genome sequence, followed by the resequencing of tomato cultivars and its wild relatives, has provided a prodigious resource for the improvement of traits. A high-quality genome resequencing of 84 tomato accessions and wild relatives generated a dataset that can be used as a resource to identify agronomically important alleles across the genome. Converting this dataset into a searchable database, including information about the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on protein function, provides valuable information about the genetic variations. The database will assist in searching for functional variants of a gene for introgression into tomato cultivars.<h4>Results</h4>A recent release of better-quality tomato genome reference assembly SL3.0, and new annotation ITAG3.2 of SL3.0, dropped 3857 genes, added 4900 novel genes and updated 20 766 genes. Using the above version, we remapped the data from the tomato lines resequenced under the '100 tomato genome resequencing project' on new tomato genome assembly SL3.0 and made an online searchable Tomato Genomic Variations (TGVs) database. The TGV contains information about SNPs and insertion/deletion events and expands it by functional annotation of variants with new ITAG3.2 using SIFT4G software. This database with search function assists in inferring the influence of SNPs on the function of a target gene. This database can be used for selecting SNPs, which can be potentially deployed for improving tomato traits.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>TGV is freely available at http://psd.uohyd.ac.in/tgv.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

This study was conducted to explore the enset genome to develop molecular markers, genomics resources, and characterize enset landraces while giving insight into the organization of the genome. We identified 233 microsatellites (simple sequence repeats, SSRs) per Mbp in the enset genome, representing 0.28% of the genome. Mono- and di-nucleotide repeats motifs were found in a higher proportion than other classes of SSR-motifs. In total, 154,586 non-redundant enset microsatellite markers (EMM) were identified and 40 selected for primer development.

33021634,The Nucleome Data Bank: web-based resources to simulate and analyze the three-dimensional genome.,"We introduce the Nucleome Data Bank (NDB), a web-based platform to simulate and analyze the three-dimensional (3D) organization of genomes. The NDB enables physics-based simulation of chromosomal structural dynamics through the MEGABASE + MiChroM computational pipeline. The input of the pipeline consists of epigenetic information sourced from the Encode database; the output consists of the trajectories of chromosomal motions that accurately predict Hi-C and fluorescence insitu hybridization data, as well as multiple observations of chromosomal dynamics in vivo. As an intermediate step, users can also generate chromosomal sub-compartment annotations directly from the same epigenetic input, without the use of any DNA-DNA proximity ligation data. Additionally, the NDB freely hosts both experimental and computational structural genomics data. Besides being able to perform their own genome simulations and download the hosted data, users can also analyze and visualize the same data through custom-designed web-based tools. In particular, the one-dimensional genetic and epigenetic data can be overlaid onto accurate 3D structures of chromosomes, to study the spatial distribution of genetic and epigenetic features. The NDB aims to be a shared resource to biologists, biophysicists and all genome scientists. The NDB is available at https://ndb.rice.edu.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"seems like software, not a data resource. But also seems you may be able to obtain the underlying data.

33045721,ViruSurf: an integrated database to investigate viral sequences.,"ViruSurf, available at http://gmql.eu/virusurf/, is a large public database of viral sequences and integrated and curated metadata from heterogeneous sources (RefSeq, GenBank, COG-UK and NMDC); it also exposes computed nucleotide and amino acid variants, called from original sequences. A GISAID-specific ViruSurf database, available at http://gmql.eu/virusurf_gisaid/, offers a subset of these functionalities. Given the current pandemic outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 data are collected from the four sources; but ViruSurf contains other virus species harmful to humans, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola and Dengue. The database is centered on sequences, described from their biological, technological and organizational dimensions. In addition, the analytical dimension characterizes the sequence in terms of its annotations and variants. The web interface enables expressing complex search queries in a simple way; arbitrary search queries can freely combine conditions on attributes from the four dimensions, extracting the resulting sequences. Several example queries on the database confirm and possibly improve results from recent research papers; results can be recomputed over time and upon selected populations. Effective search over large and curated sequence data may enable faster responses to future threats that could arise from new viruses.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
33045737,INTEDE: interactome of drug-metabolizing enzymes.,"Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) are critical determinant of drug safety and efficacy, and the interactome of DMEs has attracted extensive attention. There are 3 major interaction types in an interactome: microbiome-DME interaction (MICBIO), xenobiotics-DME interaction (XEOTIC) and host protein-DME interaction (HOSPPI). The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data. First, 1047 unique DMEs (448 host and 599 microbial) were confirmed, for the first time, using their metabolizing drugs. Second, for these newly confirmed DMEs, all types of their interactions (3359 MICBIOs between 225 microbial species and 185 DMEs; 47 778 XEOTICs between 4150 xenobiotics and 501 DMEs; 7849 HOSPPIs between 565 human proteins and 566 DMEs) were comprehensively collected and then provided, which enabled the crosstalk analysis among multiple types. Because of the huge amount of accumulated data, the INTEDE made it possible to generalize key features for revealing disease etiology and optimizing clinical treatment.

The combination between local analyses and a public repository of allelic data strikes a balance between potential confidentiality issues and the need to compare results. The possibility of deploying private instances of chewie-NS facilitates the creation of nomenclature servers with a restricted user base to allow compliance with the strictest data policies. Chewie-NS allows users to easily share their own schemas and to explore publicly available schemas, including informative statistics on schemas and loci presented in interactive charts and tables. Users can retrieve all the information necessary to run a schema locally or all the alleles identified at a particular locus. The integration with the chewBBACA suite enables users to directly upload new schemas to chewie-NS, download existing schemas and synchronize local and remote schemas from chewBBACA command line version, allowing an easier integration into high-throughput analysis pipelines. The same REST API linking chewie-NS and the chewBBACA suite supports the interaction of other interfaces or pipelines with the databases available at chewie-NS, facilitating the reusability of the stored data.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"software; reassessed, allows for sharing of data","basically a database of schemas; reassessed and still yes - there is data there, I think"

As well, we introduce new CTD Anatomy pages that allow users to uniquely explore and analyze chemical-phenotype interactions from an anatomical perspective. Finally, we have enhanced CTD Chemical pages with new literature-based chemical synonyms (to improve querying) and added 1600 amino acid-based compounds (to increase chemical landscape). Together, these updates continue to augment CTD as a powerful resource for generating testable hypotheses about the etiologies and molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally influenced diseases.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
33068433,CovalentInDB: a comprehensive database facilitating the discovery of covalent inhibitors.,"Inhibitors that form covalent bonds with their targets have traditionally been considered highly adventurous due to their potential off-target effects and toxicity concerns. However, with the clinical validation and approval of many covalent inhibitors during the past decade, design and discovery of novel covalent inhibitors have attracted increasing attention. A large amount of scattered experimental data for covalent inhibitors have been reported, but a resource by integrating the experimental information for covalent inhibitor discovery is still lacking. In this study, we presented Covalent Inhibitor Database (CovalentInDB), the largest online database that provides the structural information and experimental data for covalent inhibitors. CovalentInDB contains 4511 covalent inhibitors (including 68 approved drugs) with 57 different reactive warheads for 280 protein targets.

33079992,PLncDB V2.0: a comprehensive encyclopedia of plant long noncoding RNAs.,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with little or no protein coding potential. The expanding list of lncRNAs and accumulating evidence of their functions in plants have necessitated the creation of a comprehensive database for lncRNA research. However, currently available plant lncRNA databases have some deficiencies, including the lack of lncRNA data from some model plants, uneven annotation standards, a lack of visualization for expression patterns, and the absence of epigenetic information. To overcome these problems, we upgraded our Plant Long noncoding RNA Database (PLncDB, http://plncdb.tobaccodb.org/), which was based on a uniform annotation pipeline. PLncDB V2.0 currently contains 1 246 372 lncRNAs for 80 plant species based on 13 834 RNA-Seq datasets, integrating lncRNA information from four other resources including EVLncRNAs, RNAcentral and etc. Expression patterns and epigenetic signals can be visualized using multiple tools (JBrowse, eFP Browser and EPexplorer). Targets and regulatory networks for lncRNAs are also provided for function exploration. In addition, PLncDB V2.0 is hierarchical and user-friendly and has five built-in search engines. We believe PLncDB V2.0 is useful for the plant lncRNA community and data mining studies and provides a comprehensive resource for data-driven lncRNA research in plants.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

33095860,CNCDatabase: a database of non-coding cancer drivers.,"Most mutations in cancer genomes occur in the non-coding regions with unknown impact on tumor development. Although the increase in the number of cancer whole-genome sequences has revealed numerous putative non-coding cancer drivers, their information is dispersed across multiple studies making it difficult to understand their roles in tumorigenesis of different cancer types. We have developed CNCDatabase, Cornell Non-coding Cancer driver Database (https://cncdatabase.med.cornell.edu/) that contains detailed information about predicted non-coding drivers at gene promoters, 5' and 3' UTRs (untranslated regions), enhancers, CTCF insulators and non-coding RNAs. CNCDatabase documents 1111 protein-coding genes and 90 non-coding RNAs with reported drivers in their non-coding regions from 32 cancer types by computational predictions of positive selection using whole-genome sequences; differential gene expression in samples with and without mutations; or another set of experimental validations including luciferase reporter assays and genome editing. The database can be easily modified and scaled as lists of non-coding drivers are revised in the community with larger whole-genome sequencing studies, CRISPR screens and further experimental validations. Overall, CNCDatabase provides a helpful resource for researchers to explore the pathological role of non-coding alterations in human cancers.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

India encompasses more than 17% of the world population with extensive genetic diversity, but is under-represented in the global sequencing datasets. This gave us the impetus to perform and analyze the whole genome sequencing of 1029 healthy Indian individuals under the pilot phase of the 'IndiGen' program. We generated a compendium of 55,898,122 single allelic genetic variants from geographically distinct Indian genomes and calculated the allele frequency, allele count, allele number, along with the number of heterozygous or homozygous individuals. In the present study, these variants were systematically annotated using publicly available population databases and can be accessed through a browsable online database named as 'IndiGenomes' http://clingen.igib.res.in/indigen/.

33119751,The MemMoRF database for recognizing disordered protein regions interacting with cellular membranes.,"Protein and lipid membrane interactions play fundamental roles in a large number of cellular processes (e.g. signalling, vesicle trafficking, or viral invasion). A growing number of examples indicate that such interactions can also rely on intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs), which can form specific reversible interactions not only with proteins but also with lipids. We named IDRs involved in such membrane lipid-induced disorder-to-order transition as MemMoRFs, in an analogy to IDRs exhibiting disorder-to-order transition upon interaction with protein partners termed Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs). Currently, both the experimental detection and computational characterization of MemMoRFs are challenging, and information about these regions are scattered in the literature. To facilitate the related investigations we generated a comprehensive database of experimentally validated MemMoRFs based on manual curation of literature and structural data. To characterize the dynamics of MemMoRFs, secondary structure propensity and flexibility calculated from nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts were incorporated into the database. These data were supplemented by inclusion of sentences from papers, functional data and disease-related information. The MemMoRF database can be accessed via a user-friendly interface at https://memmorf.hegelab.org, potentially providing a central resource for the characterization of disordered regions in transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

33151298,GRNdb: decoding the gene regulatory networks in diverse human and mouse conditions.,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) formed by transcription factors (TFs) and their downstream target genes play essential roles in gene expression regulation. Moreover, GRNs can be dynamic changing across different conditions, which are crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease pathogenesis. However, no existing database provides comprehensive GRN information for various human and mouse normal tissues and diseases at the single-cell level. Based on the known TF-target relationships and the large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data collected from public databases as well as the bulk data of The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, we systematically predicted the GRNs of 184 different physiological and pathological conditions of human and mouse involving >633 000 cells and >27 700 bulk samples. We further developed GRNdb, a freely accessible and user-friendly database (http://www.grndb.com/) for searching, comparing, browsing, visualizing, and downloading the predicted information of 77 746 GRNs, 19 687 841 TF-target pairs, and related binding motifs at single-cell/bulk resolution. GRNdb also allows users to explore the gene expression profile, correlations, and the associations between expression levels and the patient survival of diverse cancers. Overall, GRNdb provides a valuable and timely resource to the scientific community to elucidate the functions and mechanisms of gene expression regulation in various conditions.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

The study of model legumes has played vital roles in deciphering key genes, pathways, and networks regulating biological mechanisms and agronomic traits. Along with emerging breeding technology such as genome editing, translation of the knowledge gained from model plants to crops is in high demand. The updated database (V3) was redesigned for translational genomics targeting the discovery of novel key genes in less-studied non-model legume crops by referring to the knowledge gained in model legumes. The database contains genomic data for all 22 included species, and transcriptomic data covering thousands of RNA-seq samples mostly from model species. The rich biological data and analytic tools for gene expression and pathway analyses can be used to decipher critical genes, pathways, and networks in model legumes. The integrated comparative genomic functions further facilitate the translation of this knowledge to legume crops. Therefore, the database will be a valuable resource to identify important genes regulating specific biological mechanisms or agronomic traits in the non-model yet economically significant legume crops.

The limited size of functional domains and the low level of sequence similarity challenge usual bioinformatics tools. The identification of lectin domains in proteomes requires the manual curation of sequence alignments based on structural folds. A new lectin classification is proposed. It is built on three levels: (i) 35 lectin domain folds, (ii) 109 classes of lectins sharing at least 20% sequence similarity and (iii) 350 families of lectins sharing at least 70% sequence similarity. This information is compiled in the UniLectin platform that includes the previously described UniLectin3D database of curated lectin 3D structures. Since its first release, UniLectin3D has been updated with 485 additional 3D structures.

Over the last decade an increasing share of biological experiments involve multiple technologies assaying different biological modalities, such as epigenetics, and RNA and protein expression, and thus the BioStudies database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies) was established to deal with such multimodal data. Its central concept is a study, which typically is associated with a publication. BioStudies stores metadata describing the study, provides links to the relevant databases, such as European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), as well as hosts the types of data for which specialized databases do not exist. With BioStudies now fully functional, we are able to further harmonize the archival data infrastructure at EMBL-EBI, and ArrayExpress is being migrated to BioStudies. In future, all functional genomics data will be archived at BioStudies.

The new GO-CAM annotation framework was notably improved, and we formalized the model with a computational schema to check and validate the rapidly increasing repository of 2838 GO-CAMs. In addition, we describe the impacts of several collaborations to refine GO and report a 10% increase in the number of GO annotations, a 25% increase in annotated gene products, and over 9,400 new scientific articles annotated. As the project matures, we continue our efforts to review older annotations in light of newer findings, and, to maintain consistency with other ontologies. As a result, 20 000 annotations derived from experimental data were reviewed, corresponding to 2.5% of experimental GO annotations. The website (http://geneontology.org) was redesigned for quick access to documentation, downloads and tools. To maintain an accurate resource and support traceability and reproducibility, we have made available a historical archive covering the past 15 years of GO data with a consistent format and file structure for both the ontology and annotations.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

The evolutionary classification is based on a library of over 15,000 phylogenetic trees, and the functional classifications include Gene Ontology terms and pathways. Here, we analyze the current coverage of genes from genomes in different taxonomic groups, so that users can better understand what to expect when analyzing a gene list using PANTHER tools. We also describe extensive improvements to PANTHER made in the past two years. The PANTHER Protein Class ontology has been completely refactored, and 6101 PANTHER families have been manually assigned to a Protein Class, providing a high level classification of protein families and their genes. Users can access the TreeGrafter tool to add their own protein sequences to the reference phylogenetic trees in PANTHER, to infer evolutionary context as well as fine-grained annotations. We have added human enhancer-gene links that associate non-coding regions with the annotated human genes in PANTHER. We have also expanded the available services for programmatic access to PANTHER tools and data via application programming interfaces (APIs).

33294866,Pancreatlas: Applying an Adaptable Framework to Map the Human Pancreas in Health and Disease.,"Human tissue phenotyping generates complex spatial information from numerous imaging modalities, yet images typically become static figures for publication, and original data and metadata are rarely available. While comprehensive image maps exist for some organs, most resources have limited support for multiplexed imaging or have non-intuitive user interfaces. Therefore, we built a Pancreatlas resource that integrates several technologies into a unique interface, allowing users to access richly annotated web pages, drill down to individual images, and deeply explore data online. The current version of Pancreatlas contains over 800 unique images acquired by whole-slide scanning, confocal microscopy, and imaging mass cytometry, and is available at https://www.pancreatlas.org. To create this human pancreas-specific biological imaging resource, we developed a React-based web application and Python-based application programming interface, collectively called Flexible Framework for Integrating and Navigating Data (FFIND), which can be adapted beyond Pancreatlas to meet countless imaging or other structured data-management needs.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
33301927,Phylogenomic study and classification of mitochondrial DNA through virtual genomic fingerprints.,"In the present study, we evaluated the ability of the Virtual Analysis Method for Phylogenomic fingerprint Estimation (VAMPhyRE) toolkit to classify human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups. In total, 357 random mtDNA sequences were obtained from different haplogroups, based on the classification of PhyloTree. Additionally, we included a control group of five sequences (Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis, Yoruba15, and the revised Cambridge reference sequence). VAMPhyRE employs a virtual hybridization technique, using probes that specifically bind to their complementary sequences in the genome. We used 65,536 probes of 8 nucleotides to identify potential sites where hybridization occurs between the mtDNA and the specific probe, forming different heteroduplexes and thus, creating a unique and specific genomic fingerprint for each sequence. Genomic fingerprints were compared, and a table of distances was calculated to obtain a mitochondrial phylogenomic tree with the macrohaplogroups, L, N, M, and R, and their corresponding haplogroups, according to universal nomenclature. The results obtained suggest an accuracy of 97.25% for the distribution of the 357 mtDNA sequences in the four macrohaplogroups and their corresponding haplogroups when compared with other mtDNA classification tools that require reference sequences and do not offer an analysis based on an evolutionary approach.

33330918,Systematic evaluation of the effects of genetic variants on PIWI-interacting RNA expression across 33 cancer types.,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs involved in tumorigenesis. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis has been demonstrated to help reveal the genetic mechanism of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cancer etiology. However, there are no databases that have been constructed to provide an eQTL analysis between SNPs and piRNA expression. In this study, we collected genotyping and piRNA expression data for 10 997 samples across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using linear regression cis-eQTL analysis with adjustment of appropriate covariates, we identified millions of SNP-piRNA pairs in tumor (76 924 831) and normal (24 431 061) tissues. Further, we performed differential expression and survival analyses, and linked the eQTLs to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data to comprehensively decipher the functional roles of identified cis-piRNA eQTLs. Finally, we developed a user-friendly database, piRNA-eQTL (http://njmu-edu.cn:3838/piRNA-eQTL/), to help users query, browse and download corresponding eQTL results. In summary, piRNA-eQTL could serve as an important resource to assist the research community in understanding the roles of genetic variants and piRNAs in the development of cancers.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

33382886,Creating a Metabolic Syndrome Research Resource using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is multifaceted. Risk factors include visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension and environmental stimuli. MetS leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke. Comparative studies, however, have identified heterogeneity in the pathology of MetS across groups though the etiology of these differences has yet to be elucidated. The Metabolic Syndrome Research Resource (MetSRR) described in this report is a curated database that provides access to MetS-associated biological and ancillary data and pools current and potential biomarkers of MetS extracted from relevant National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999-2016. Each potential biomarker was selected following the review of over 100 peer-reviewed articles. MetSRR includes 28 demographics, survey and known MetS-related variables, including 9 curated categorical variables and 42 potentially novel biomarkers. All measures are captured from over 90‚Äâ000 individuals. This biocuration effort provides increased access to curated MetS-related data and will serve as a hypothesis-generating tool to aid in novel biomarker discovery. In addition, MetSRR provides the ability to generate and export ethnic group-/race-, sex- and age-specific curated datasets, thus broadening participation in research efforts to identify clinically evaluative MetS biomarkers for disparate populations. Although there are other databases, such as BioM2MetDisease, designed to explore metabolic diseases through analysis of miRNAs and disease phenotypes, MetSRR is the only MetS-specific database designed to explore etiology of MetS across groups, through the biocuration of demographic, biological samples and biometric data.

Due to their coordinative role in adaptive immune responses, DCs have been used as cell-based therapeutic vaccination against cancer. The capacity of DCs to induce a therapeutic immune response can be enhanced by re-wiring of cellular signalling pathways with microRNAs (miRNAs). <b>Methods:</b> Since the activation and maturation of DCs is controlled by an interconnected signalling network, we deploy an approach that combines RNA sequencing data and systems biology methods to delineate miRNA-based strategies that enhance DC-elicited immune responses. <b>Results:</b> Through RNA sequencing of IKKŒ≤-matured DCs that are currently being tested in a clinical trial on therapeutic anti-cancer vaccination, we identified 44 differentially expressed miRNAs. According to a network analysis, most of these miRNAs regulate targets that are linked to immune pathways, such as cytokine and interleukin signalling. We employed a network topology-oriented scoring model to rank the miRNAs, analysed their impact on immunogenic potency of DCs, and identified dozens of promising miRNA candidates, with miR-15a and miR-16 as the top ones. The results of our analysis are presented in a database that constitutes a tool to identify DC-relevant miRNA-gene interactions with therapeutic potential (https://www.synmirapy.net/dc-optimization). <b>Conclusions:</b> Our approach enables the systematic analysis and identification of functional miRNA-gene interactions that can be experimentally tested for improving DC immunogenic potency.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
33401309,ADeditome provides the genomic landscape of A-to-I RNA editing in Alzheimer's disease.,"A-to-I RNA editing, contributing to nearly 90% of all editing events in human, has been reported to involve in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its roles in brain development and immune regulation, such as the deficient editing of GluA2 Q/R related to cell death and memory loss. Currently, there are urgent needs for the systematic annotations of A-to-I RNA editing events in AD. Here, we built ADeditome, the annotation database of A-to-I RNA editing in AD available at https://ccsm.uth.edu/ADeditome, aiming to provide a resource and reference for functional annotation of A-to-I RNA editing in AD to identify therapeutically targetable genes in an individual. We detected 1676 363 editing sites in 1524 samples across nine brain regions from ROSMAP, MayoRNAseq and MSBB. For these editing events, we performed multiple functional annotations including identification of specific and disease stage associated editing events and the influence of editing events on gene expression, protein recoding, alternative splicing and miRNA regulation for all the genes, especially for AD-related genes in order to explore the pathology of AD. Combing all the analysis results, we found 108 010 and 26 168 editing events which may promote or inhibit AD progression, respectively. We also found 5582 brain region-specific editing events with potentially dual roles in AD across different brain regions. ADeditome will be a unique resource for AD and drug research communities to identify therapeutically targetable editing events. Significance: ADeditome is the first comprehensive resource of the functional genomics of individual A-to-I RNA editing events in AD, which will be useful for many researchers in the fields of AD pathology, precision medicine, and therapeutic researches.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Given the challenge to target those interfaces with small chemical compounds, it has become clear that learning from successful examples of PPI modulation is a powerful strategy. Freely-accessible databases of PPI modulators that provide the community with tractable chemical and pharmacological data, as well as powerful tools to query them, are therefore essential to stimulate new drug discovery projects on PPI targets.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the new version iPPI-DB, our manually curated database of PPI modulators. In this completely redesigned version of the database, we introduce a new web interface relying on crowdsourcing for the maintenance of the database. This interface was created to enable community contributions, whereby external experts can suggest new database entries. Moreover, the data model, the graphical interface, and the tools to query the database have been completely modernized and improved. We added new PPI modulators, new PPI targets, and extended our focus to stabilizers of PPIs as well.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The iPPI-DB server is available at https://ippidb.pasteur.fr The source code for this server is available at https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/ippidb/ippidb-web/ and is distributed under GPL licence (http://www.gnu.org/licences/gpl).

33461215,Ligand-based approach for predicting drug targets and for virtual screening against COVID-19.,"Discovering efficient drugs and identifying target proteins are still an unmet but urgent need for curing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Protein structure-based docking is a widely applied approach for discovering active compounds against drug targets and for predicting potential targets of active compounds. However, this approach has its inherent deficiency caused by e.g. various different conformations with largely varied binding pockets adopted by proteins, or the lack of true target proteins in the database. This deficiency may result in false negative results. As a complementary approach to the protein structure-based platform for COVID-19, termed as D3Docking in our previous work, we developed in this study a ligand-based method, named D3Similarity, which is based on the molecular similarity evaluation between the submitted molecule(s) and those in an active compound database. The database is constituted by all the reported bioactive molecules against the coronaviruses, viz., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (HCoV-EMC), human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), some of which have target or mechanism information but some do not. Based on the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) similarity evaluation of molecular structures, virtual screening and target prediction could be performed according to similarity ranking results. With two examples, we demonstrated the reliability and efficiency of D3Similarity by using 2D‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ3D value as score for drug discovery and target prediction against COVID-19.

New approaches are urgently needed to prioritize variants, especially those that are rare or lack a definitive clinical interpretation. We examined 10,136,597 human missense genetic variants from GnomAD, ClinVar and UniProt. We were able to perform large-scale atom-based mapping and phenotype interpretation of 3,960,015 of these variants onto 18,874 experimental and 84,818 in house predicted three-dimensional coordinates of the human proteome. We demonstrate that 14% of amino acid substitutions from the GnomAD database that could be structurally analysed are predicted to affect protein structure (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ568,548, of which 566,439 rare or extremely rare) and may, therefore, have a yet unknown disease-causing effect.

For each of the 4 M variants, the results of the structural analysis are presented in a friendly concise format that can be included in clinical genetic reports. A detailed report of the structural analysis is also available for the non-experts in structural biology. Population frequency and predictions from SIFT and PolyPhen are included for a more comprehensive variant interpretation.

However, current human-virus PPI database resources are incomplete, lack annotation and usually do not provide the opportunity to computationally predict human-virus PPIs. Here, we present the Human-Virus Interaction DataBase (HVIDB, http://zzdlab.com/hvidb/) that provides comprehensively annotated human-virus PPI data as well as seamlessly integrates online PPI prediction tools. Currently, HVIDB highlights 48 643 experimentally verified human-virus PPIs covering 35 virus families, 6633 virally targeted host complexes, 3572 host dependency/restriction factors as well as 911 experimentally verified/predicted 3D complex structures of human-virus PPIs. Furthermore, our database resource provides tissue-specific expression profiles of 6790 human genes that are targeted by viruses and 129 Gene Expression Omnibus series of differentially expressed genes post-viral infections. Based on these multifaceted and annotated data, our database allows the users to easily obtain reliable information about PPIs of various human viruses and conduct an in-depth analysis of their inherent biological significance. In particular, HVIDB also integrates well-performing machine learning models to predict interactions between the human host and viral proteins that are based on (i) sequence embedding techniques, (ii) interolog mapping and (iii) domain-domain interaction inference.

33643383,Abiotic Stress-Responsive miRNA and Transcription Factor-Mediated Gene Regulatory Network in <i>Oryza sativa</i>: Construction and Structural Measure Study.,"Climate changes and environmental stresses have a consequential association with crop plant growth and yield, meaning it is necessary to cultivate crops that have tolerance toward the changing climate and environmental disturbances such as water stress, temperature fluctuation, and salt toxicity. Recent studies have shown that trans-acting regulatory elements, including microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs), are emerging as promising tools for engineering naive improved crop varieties with tolerance for multiple environmental stresses and enhanced quality as well as yield. However, the interwoven complex regulatory function of TFs and miRNAs at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels is unexplored in <i>Oryza sativa</i>. To this end, we have constructed a multiple abiotic stress responsive TF-miRNA-gene regulatory network for <i>O. sativa</i> using a transcriptome and degradome sequencing data meta-analysis approach. The theoretical network approach has shown the networks to be dense, scale-free, and small-world, which makes the network stable. They are also invariant to scale change where an efficient, quick transmission of biological signals occurs within the network on extrinsic hindrance. The analysis also deciphered the existence of communities (cluster of TF, miRNA, and genes) working together to help plants in acclimatizing to multiple stresses. It highlighted that genes, TFs, and miRNAs shared by multiple stress conditions that work as hubs or bottlenecks for signal propagation, for example, during the interaction between stress-responsive genes (TFs/miRNAs/other genes) and genes involved in floral development pathways under multiple environmental stresses. This study further highlights how the fine-tuning feedback mechanism works for balancing stress tolerance and how timely flowering enable crops to survive in adverse conditions. This study developed the abiotic stress-responsive regulatory network, APRegNet database (http://lms.snu.edu.in/APRegNet), which may help researchers studying the roles of miRNAs and TFs. Furthermore, it advances current understanding of multiple abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
33655207,TMSNP: a web server to predict pathogenesis of missense mutations in the transmembrane region of membrane proteins.,"The massive amount of data generated from genome sequencing brings tons of newly identified mutations, whose pathogenic/non-pathogenic effects need to be evaluated. This has given rise to several mutation predictor tools that, in general, do not consider the specificities of the various protein groups. We aimed to develop a predictor tool dedicated to membrane proteins, under the premise that their specific structural features and environment would give different responses to mutations compared to globular proteins. For this purpose, we created TMSNP, a database that currently contains information from 2624 pathogenic and 196 705 non-pathogenic reported mutations located in the transmembrane region of membrane proteins. By computing various conservation parameters on these mutations in combination with annotations, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify mutations as pathogenic or not. TMSNP (freely available at http://lmc.uab.es/tmsnp/) improves considerably the prediction power of commonly used mutation predictors trained with globular proteins.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"software; reassess, resulted in database",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource as the outcome of a program

However, none of these has yet collected experimental results of compound-related health changes. Since quality of life is often regarded as more valuable than length of life, we aim to fill this gap with the ""Healthy Worm Database"" ( http://healthy-worm-database.eu ). Literature describing health-related compound studies in the aging model Caenorhabditis elegans was screened, and data for 440 compounds collected. The database considers 189 publications describing 89 different phenotypes measured in 2995 different conditions. Besides enabling a targeted search for promising compounds for further investigations, this database also offers insights into the research field of studies on healthy aging based on a frequently used model organism. Some weaknesses of C. elegans-based aging studies, like underrepresented phenotypes, especially concerning cognitive functions, as well as the convenience-based use of young worms as the starting point for compound treatment or phenotype measurement are discussed. In conclusion, the database provides an anchor for the search for compounds affecting health, with a link to public databases, and it further highlights some potential shortcomings in current aging research.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
33685383,lncRNADetector: a bioinformatics pipeline for long non-coding RNA identification and MAPslnc: a repository of medicinal and aromatic plant lncRNAs.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs and potent regulatory elements in the living cells. High throughput RNA sequencing analyses have generated a tremendous amount of transcript sequence data. A large proportion of these transcript sequences does not code for proteins and are known as non-coding RNAs. Among them, lncRNAs are a unique class of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with diverse biological functions and regulatory mechanisms. Recent emerging studies and next-generation sequencing technologies show a substantial amount of lncRNAs within the plant genome, which are yet to be identified. The computational identification of lncRNAs from these transcripts is a challenging task due to the involvement of a series of filtering steps. We have developed lncRNADetector, a bioinformatics pipeline for the identification of novel lncRNAs, especially from medicinal and aromatic plant (MAP) species. The lncRNADetector has been utilized to analyse and identify more than 88,459 lncRNAs from 21 species of MAPs. To provide a knowledge resource for the plant research community towards elucidating the diversity of biological roles of lncRNAs, the information generated about MAP lncRNAs (post-filtering steps) through lncRNADetector has been stored and organized in MAPslnc database (MAPslnc, https://lncrnapipe.cimap.res.in). The lncRNADetector web server and MAPslnc database have been developed in order to facilitate researchers for accurate identification of lncRNAs from the next-generation sequencing data of different organisms for downstream studies.

Applied to single-cell data, such analyses provide mechanistic insights into individual cells and their interactions. However, knowledge of intercellular communication is scarce, scattered across resources, and not linked to intracellular processes. To address this gap, we combined over 100 resources covering interactions and roles of proteins in inter- and intracellular signaling, as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We added protein complex information and annotations on function, localization, and role in diseases for each protein. The resource is available for human, and via homology translation for mouse and rat. The data are accessible via OmniPath's web service (https://omnipathdb.org/), a Cytoscape plug-in, and packages in R/Bioconductor and Python, providing access options for computational and experimental scientists. We created workflows with tutorials to facilitate the analysis of cell-cell interactions and affected downstream intracellular signaling processes.

All data are provided as an online resource (https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/MRECA/Nephron/). Many of the genes expressed in unique patterns along the renal tubule were solute carriers, transcription factors, or G protein-coupled receptors that account for segment-specific function. Mapping the distribution of transcripts associated with Wnk-SPAK-PKA signaling, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone signaling, and cystic diseases of the kidney illustrated the applications of the online resource. The method allowed full-length mapping of RNA-seq reads, which facilitated comprehensive, unbiased characterization of alternative exon usage along the renal tubule, including known isoforms of <i>Cldn10</i>, <i>Kcnj1</i> (ROMK), <i>Slc12a1</i> (NKCC2), <i>Wnk1</i>, <i>Stk39</i> (SPAK), and <i>Slc14a2</i> (UT-A urea transporter).

33780471,MCPdb: The bacterial microcompartment database.,"Bacterial microcompartments are organelle-like structures composed entirely of proteins. They have evolved to carry out several distinct and specialized metabolic functions in a wide variety of bacteria. Their outer shell is constructed from thousands of tessellating protein subunits, encapsulating enzymes that carry out the internal metabolic reactions. The shell proteins are varied, with single, tandem and permuted versions of the PF00936 protein family domain comprising the primary structural component of their polyhedral architecture, which is reminiscent of a viral capsid. While considerable amounts of structural and biophysical data have been generated in the last 15 years, the existing functionalities of current resources have limited our ability to rapidly understand the functional and structural properties of microcompartments (MCPs) and their diversity. In order to make the remarkable structural features of bacterial microcompartments accessible to a broad community of scientists and non-specialists, we developed MCPdb: The Bacterial Microcompartment Database (https://mcpdb.mbi.ucla.edu/). MCPdb is a comprehensive resource that categorizes and organizes known microcompartment protein structures and their larger assemblies. To emphasize the critical roles symmetric assembly and architecture play in microcompartment function, each structure in the MCPdb is validated and annotated with respect to: (1) its predicted natural assembly state (2) tertiary structure and topology and (3) the metabolic compartment type from which it derives.

These increases in volume, diversity and complexity of the data generated and their analysis expose the necessity of a structured and standardized reporting template. BioCompute Objects (BCOs) provide the requisite support for communication of HTS data analysis that includes support for workflow, as well as data, curation, accessibility and reproducibility of communication. BCOs standardize how researchers report provenance and the established verification and validation protocols used in workflows while also being robust enough to convey content integration or curation in knowledge bases. BCOs that encapsulate tools, platforms, datasets and workflows are FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) compliant. Providing operational workflow and data information facilitates interoperability between platforms and incorporation of future dataset within an HTS analysis for use within industrial, academic and regulatory settings. Cloud-based platforms, including High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE), Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) and Galaxy, support BCO generation for users. Given the 100K+ userbase between these platforms, BioCompute can be leveraged for workflow documentation. In this paper, we report the availability of platform-dependent and platform-independent BCO tools: HIVE BCO App, CGC BCO App, Galaxy BCO API Extension and BCO Portal. Community engagement was utilized to evaluate tool efficacy. We demonstrate that these tools further advance BCO creation from text editing approaches used in earlier releases of the standard. Moreover, we demonstrate that integrating BCO generation within existing analysis platforms greatly streamlines BCO creation while capturing granular workflow details. We also demonstrate that the BCO tools described in the paper provide an approach to solve the long-standing challenge of standardizing workflow descriptions that are both human and machine readable while accommodating manual and automated curation with evidence tagging.

33843105,Sequence and evolutionary analysis of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins.,"The multi-domain bacterial S1 protein is the largest and most functionally important ribosomal protein of the 30S subunit, which interacts with both mRNA and proteins. The family of ribosomal S1 proteins differs in the classical sense from a protein with tandem repeats and has a ""bead-on-string"" organization, where each repeat is folded into a globular domain. Based on our recent data, the study of evolutionary relationships for the bacterial phyla will provide evidence for one of the proposed theories of the evolutionary development of proteins with structural repeats: from multiple repeats of assembles to single repeats, or vice versa. In this comparative analysis of 1333 S1 sequences that were identified in 24 different phyla, we demonstrate how such phyla can form independently/dependently during evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study of the evolutionary history of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins. The collected and structured data can be useful to computer biologists as a resource for determining percent identity, amino acid composition and logo motifs, as well as dN/dS ratio in bacterial S1 protein. The obtained research data indicate that the evolutionary development of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins evolved from multiple assemblies to single repeat.

33858848,HLA Ligand Atlas: a benign reference of HLA-presented peptides to improve T-cell-based cancer immunotherapy.,"<h4>Background</h4>The human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex controls adaptive immunity by presenting defined fractions of the intracellular and extracellular protein content to immune cells. Understanding the benign HLA ligand repertoire is a prerequisite to define safe T-cell-based immunotherapies against cancer. Due to the poor availability of benign tissues, if available, normal tissue adjacent to the tumor has been used as a benign surrogate when defining tumor-associated antigens. However, this comparison has proven to be insufficient and even resulted in lethal outcomes. In order to match the tumor immunopeptidome with an equivalent counterpart, we created the HLA Ligand Atlas, the first extensive collection of paired HLA-I and HLA-II immunopeptidomes from 227 benign human tissue samples. This dataset facilitates a balanced comparison between tumor and benign tissues on HLA ligand level.<h4>Methods</h4>Human tissue samples were obtained from 16 subjects at autopsy, five thymus samples and two ovary samples originating from living donors. HLA ligands were isolated via immunoaffinity purification and analyzed in over 1200 liquid chromatography mass spectrometry runs. Experimentally and computationally reproducible protocols were employed for data acquisition and processing.<h4>Results</h4>The initial release covers 51 HLA-I and 86 HLA-II allotypes presenting 90,428 HLA-I- and 142,625 HLA-II ligands. The HLA allotypes are representative for the world population. We observe that immunopeptidomes differ considerably between tissues and individuals on source protein and HLA-ligand level. Moreover, we discover 1407 HLA-I ligands from non-canonical genomic regions. Such peptides were previously described in tumors, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), healthy lung tissues and cell lines. In a case study in glioblastoma, we show that potential on-target off-tumor adverse events in immunotherapy can be avoided by comparing tumor immunopeptidomes to the provided multi-tissue reference.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Given that T-cell-based immunotherapies, such as CAR-T cells, affinity-enhanced T cell transfer, cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibition, have significant side effects, the HLA Ligand Atlas is the first step toward defining tumor-associated targets with an improved safety profile. The resource provides insights into basic and applied immune-associated questions in the context of cancer immunotherapy, infection, transplantation, allergy and autoimmunity.

33876217,CanDriS: posterior profiling of cancer-driving sites based on two-component evolutionary model.,"Current cancer genomics databases have accumulated millions of somatic mutations that remain to be further explored. Due to the over-excess mutations unrelated to cancer, the great challenge is to identify somatic mutations that are cancer-driven. Under the notion that carcinogenesis is a form of somatic-cell evolution, we developed a two-component mixture model: while the ground component corresponds to passenger mutations, the rapidly evolving component corresponds to driver mutations. Then, we implemented an empirical Bayesian procedure to calculate the posterior probability of a site being cancer-driven. Based on these, we developed a software CanDriS (Cancer Driver Sites) to profile the potential cancer-driving sites for thousands of tumor samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas and International Cancer Genome Consortium across tumor types and pan-cancer level. As a result, we identified that approximately 1% of the sites have posterior probabilities larger than 0.90 and listed potential cancer-wide and cancer-specific driver mutations. By comprehensively profiling all potential cancer-driving sites, CanDriS greatly enhances our ability to refine our knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer and might guide clinical medication in the upcoming era of precision medicine.

In addition, once a xenobiotic is biotransformed with distinct half-lives upon exposure, monitoring the parent compounds alone may not reflect the actual human exposure. To address these questions, a comprehensive and risk-prioritized human exposome database is needed.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our objective was to set up a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database including physicochemical properties as well as risk prediction and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that has the ability to conduct searches for content associated with chemicals in our database.<h4>Methods</h4>We built a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database by text mining and database fusion. Subsequently, chemicals were prioritized by integrating exposure level obtained from the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models with toxicity data predicted by the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool and the Toxicological Priority Index calculated from the ToxCast database.

It is estimated to account for 6% of all phosphorylated amino acids. However, due to the acid lability of the PN bond, the study of pHis lags far behind that of pSer, pThr, and pTyr. Recently, the development and use of pHis-specific antibodies and methodologies have led to a resurgence in the study of histidine phosphorylation. Although a considerable number of pHis proteins and sites have been discovered, most of them have not been manually curated and integrated to any databases. There is a lack of a data repository for pHis, and such work is expected to help further systemic studies of pHis. Thus, we present a comprehensive resource database of histidine phosphorylation (HisPhosSite) by curating experimentally validated pHis proteins and sites and compiling putative pHis sites with ortholog search. HisPhosSite contains 776 verified pHis sites and 2702 verified pHis proteins in 38 eukaryotic and prokaryotic species and 15,378 putative pHis sites and 10,816 putative pHis proteins in 1366 species.

33993461,TUPDB: Target-Unrelated Peptide Data Bank.,"The isolation of target-unrelated peptides (TUPs) through biopanning remains as a major problem of phage display selection experiments. These TUPs do not have any actual affinity toward targets of interest, which tend to be mistakenly identified as target-binding peptides. Therefore, an information portal for storing TUP data is urgently needed. Here, we present a TUP data bank (TUPDB), which is a comprehensive, manually curated database of approximately 73 experimentally verified TUPs and 1963 potential TUPs collected from TUPScan, the BDB database, and public research articles. The TUPScan tool has been integrated in TUPDB to facilitate TUP analysis. We believe that TUPDB can help identify and remove TUPs in future reports in the biopanning community. The database is of great importance to improving the quality of phage display-based epitope mapping and promoting the development of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics.

Data can be difficult to find despite existing online blood group resources and genetic and literature databases. We have developed a modern, elaborate database for D variants, thanks to an extensive literature search with meticulous curation of 387 peer-reviewed articles and 80 abstracts from major conferences and other sources. RHeference contains entries for 710 RHD alleles, 11 RHCE alleles, 30 phenotype descriptions (preventing data loss from historical sources), 35 partly characterized alleles, 3 haplotypes, and 16 miscellaneous entries. The entries include molecular, phenotypic, serological, alloimmunization, haplotype, geographical, and other data, detailed for each source. The main characteristics are summarized for each entry. The sources for all information are included and easily accessible through doi and PMID links. Overall, the database contains more than 10,000 individual pieces of data. We have set up the database architecture based on our previous expertise on database setup and biocuration for other topics, using modern technologies such as the Django framework, BioPython, Bootstrap, and Jquery. This architecture allows an easy access to data and enables simple and complex queries: combining multiple mutations, keywords, or any of the characteristics included in the database. RHeference provides a complement to existing resources and will continue to grow as our knowledge expands and new articles are published.

Since the discovery of EV production in the fungus <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, the importance of EV release in its physiology and pathogenicity has been investigated. To date, few studies have investigated the proteomic content of EVs from multiple fungal species. Our main objective was to use an orthology approach to compare proteins identified by EV shotgun proteomics in 8 pathogenic and 1 nonpathogenic species. Using protein information from the UniProt and FungiDB databases, we integrated data for 11,433 hits in fungal EVs with an orthology perspective, resulting in 3,834 different orthologous groups. OG6_100083 (Hsp70 Pfam domain) was the unique orthologous group that was identified for all fungal species. Proteins with this protein domain are associated with the stress response, survival and morphological changes in different fungal species. Although no pathogenic orthologous group was found, we identified 5 orthologous groups exclusive to <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Using the criteria of at least 7 pathogenic fungi to define a cluster, we detected the 4 unique pathogenic orthologous groups. Taken together, our data suggest that Hsp70-related proteins might play a key role in fungal EVs, regardless of the pathogenic status. Using an orthology approach, we identified at least 4 protein domains that could be novel therapeutic targets against pathogenic fungi. Our results were compiled in the herein described ExVe database, which is publicly available at http://exve.icc.fiocruz.br.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

While the resource primarily serves the echinoderm research community, the recent release of an excellent quality genome for the frequently studied purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome, v5.0) has provided an opportunity to adapt to the needs of a broader research community across other model systems. To this end, establishing pipelines to identify orthologous genes between echinoderms and other species has become a priority in many contexts including nomenclature, linking to data in other model organisms, and in internal functionality where data gathered in one hosted species can be associated with genes in other hosted echinoderms. This paper describes the orthology pipelines currently employed by Echinobase and how orthology data are processed to yield 1:1 ortholog mappings between a variety of echinoderms and other model taxa. We also describe functions of interest that have recently been included on the resource, including an updated developmental time course for S.purpuratus, and additional tracks for genome browsing. These data enhancements will increase the accessibility of the resource to non-echinoderm researchers and simultaneously expand the data quality and quantity available to core Echinobase users.

For example, how can you determine which indexes are derived from identical raw sequence files, or which annotations share a compatible coordinate system? Here, we describe a novel approach to establish identity and compatibility of reference genome resources. We approach this with three advances: first, we derive unique identifiers for each resource; second, we record parent-child relationships among resources; and third, we describe recursive identifiers that determine identity as well as compatibility of coordinate systems and sequence names.

Kinase Enrichment Analysis 3 (KEA3) is a webserver application that infers overrepresentation of upstream kinases whose putative substrates are in a user-inputted list of proteins. KEA3 can be applied to analyze data from phosphoproteomics and proteomics studies to predict the upstream kinases responsible for observed differential phosphorylations. The KEA3 background database contains measured and predicted kinase-substrate interactions (KSI), kinase-protein interactions (KPI), and interactions supported by co-expression and co-occurrence data. To benchmark the performance of KEA3, we examined whether KEA3 can predict the perturbed kinase from single-kinase perturbation followed by gene expression experiments, and phosphoproteomics data collected from kinase-targeting small molecules. We show that integrating KSIs and KPIs across data sources to produce a composite ranking improves the recovery of the expected kinase.

Nowadays, high-throughput sequencing data on addictive substance-induced gene expression have become widely available. A resource for comprehensive annotation of genes that show differential expression in response to commonly abused substances is necessary. So, we developed AddictGene by integrating gene expression, gene-gene interaction, gene-drug interaction and epigenetic regulatory annotation for over 70,156 items of differentially expressed genes associated with 7 commonly abused substances, including alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, morphine, heroin, methamphetamine, and amphetamine, across three species (human, mouse, rat). We also collected 1,141 addiction-related experimentally validated genes by techniques such as RT-PCR, northern blot and <i>in situ</i> hybridization. The easy-to-use web interface of AddictGene (http://159.226.67.237/sun/addictgedb/) allows users to search and browse multidimensional data on DEGs of their interest: 1) detailed gene-specific information extracted from the original studies; 2) basic information about the specific gene extracted from NCBI; 3) SNP associated with substance dependence and other psychiatry disorders; 4) expression alteration of specific gene in other psychiatric disorders; 5) expression patterns of interested gene across 31 primary and 54 secondary human tissues; 6) functional annotation of interested gene; 7) epigenetic regulators involved in the alteration of specific genes, including histone modifications and DNA methylation; 8) protein-protein interaction for functional linkage with interested gene; 9) drug-gene interaction for potential druggability.

34025934,Computational modeling and bioinformatic analyses of functional mutations in drug target genes in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.,"Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be the leading cause of deaths due to its persistent drug resistance and the consequent ineffectiveness of anti-TB treatment. Recent years witnessed huge amount of sequencing data, revealing mutations responsible for drug resistance. However, the lack of an up-to-date repository remains a barrier towards utilization of these data and identifying major mutations-associated with resistance. Amongst all mutations, non-synonymous mutations alter the amino acid sequence of a protein and have a much greater effect on pathogenicity. Hence, this type of gene mutation is of prime interest of the present study. The purpose of this study is to develop an updated database comprising almost all reported substitutions within the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>) drug target genes <i>rpoB</i>, <i>inhA</i>, <i>katG</i>, <i>pncA</i>, <i>gyrA</i> and <i>gyrB.</i> Various bioinformatics prediction tools were used to assess the structural and biophysical impacts of the resistance causing non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) at the molecular level. This was followed by evaluating the impact of these mutations on binding affinity of the drugs to target proteins. We have developed a comprehensive online resource named MycoTRAP-DB (<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Resistance Associated Polymorphisms Database) that connects mutations in genes with their structural, functional and pathogenic implications on protein. This database is accessible at http://139.59.12.92. This integrated platform would enable comprehensive analysis and prioritization of SNPs for the development of improved diagnostics and antimycobacterial medications. Moreover, our study puts forward secondary mutations that can be important for prognostic assessments of drug-resistance mechanism and actionable anti-TB drugs.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
34029142,Landscape of GPCR expression along the mouse nephron.,"Kidney transport and other renal functions are regulated by multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed along the renal tubule. The rapid, recent appearance of comprehensive unbiased gene expression data in the various renal tubule segments, chiefly RNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry data, has provided a means of identifying patterns of GPCR expression along the renal tubule. To allow for comprehensive mapping, we first curated a comprehensive list of GPCRs in the genomes of mice, rats, and humans (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/GPCRs/) using multiple online data sources. We used this list to mine segment-specific and cell type-specific expression data from RNA-sequencing studies in microdissected mouse tubule segments to identify GPCRs that are selectively expressed in discrete tubule segments. Comparisons of these mapped mouse GPCRs with other omics datasets as well as functional data from isolated perfused tubule and micropuncture studies confirmed patterns of expression for well-known receptors and identified poorly studied GPCRs that are likely to play roles in the regulation of renal tubule function. Thus, we provide data resources for GPCR expression across the renal tubule, highlighting both well-known GPCRs and understudied receptors to provide guidance for future studies.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

34046592,A map of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA structurome.,"SARS-CoV-2 has exploded throughout the human population. To facilitate efforts to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and to target the virus therapeutically, it is essential to have a roadmap of likely functional regions embedded in its RNA genome. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the <i>local</i> RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the highest likelihood of being functional. We recapitulate previously-known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a large reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Results are enhanced via the re-analyses of publicly-available genome-wide biochemical structure probing datasets that are broadly in agreement with our models. Additionally, ScanFold was updated to incorporate experimental data as constraints in the analysis to facilitate comparisons between ScanFold and other RNA modelling approaches. Ultimately, ScanFold was able to identify eight highly structured/conserved motifs in SARS-CoV-2 that agree with experimental data, without explicitly using these data. All results are made available via a public database (the RNAStructuromeDB: https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2) and model comparisons are readily viewable at https://structurome.bb.iastate.edu/sars-cov-2-global-model-comparisons.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

They are characterized by multiple inhibitory repeat domains, conserved disulfide bond pattern, and a tripeptide reactive center loop. These features of Pin-II type PIs make them potential molecules for protein engineering and designing inhibitors for agricultural and therapeutic applications. However, the diversity in these PIs remains unexplored due to the lack of annotated protein sequences and their functional attributes in the available databases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a database, PINIR (Pin-II type PIs Information Resource), by systematic collection and manual annotation of 415 Pin-II type PI protein sequences. For each PI, the number and position for signature sequences are specified: 695 domains, 75 linkers, 63 reactive center loops, and 10 disulfide bond patterns are identified and mapped. Database analysis revealed novel subcategories of PIs, species-correlated occurrence of inhibitory domains, reactive center loops, and disulfide bond patterns.

34125008,"The ""second wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Arctic: regional and temporal dynamics.","This article focuses on the ""second wave"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Arctic and examines spatiotemporal patterns between July 2020 and January 2021. We analyse available COVID-19 data at the regional (subnational) level to elucidate patterns and typology of Arctic regions with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article builds upon our previous research that examined the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic between February and July 2020. The pandemic's ""second wave"" observed in the Arctic between September 2020 and January 2021 was severe in terms of COVID-19 infections and fatalities, having particularly strong impacts in Alaska, Northern Russia and Northern Sweden. Based on the spatiotemporal patterns of the ""second wave"" dynamics, we identified 5 types of the pandemic across regions: Shockwaves (Iceland, Faroe Islands, Northern Norway, and Northern Finland), Protracted Waves (Northern Sweden), Tidal Waves (Northern Russia), Tsunami Waves (Alaska), and Isolated Splashes (Northern Canada and Greenland). Although data limitations and gaps persist, monitoring of COVID-19 is critical for developing a proper understanding of the pandemic in order to develop informed and effective responses to the current crisis and possible future pandemics in the Arctic.

34127402,Immu-Mela: An open resource for exploring immunotherapy-related multidimensional genomic profiles in melanoma.,"There are increasing studies aimed to reveal genomic hallmarks predictive of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment response, which generated a large number of data and provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify response-related features and evaluate their robustness across cohorts. However, those valuable data sets are not easily accessible to the research community. To take full advantage of existing large-scale immuno-genomic profiles, we developed Immu-Mela (http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/database/Immu-Mela/), a multidimensional immuno-genomic portal that provides interactive exploration of associations between ICB responsiveness and multi-omics features in melanoma, including genetic, transcriptomics, immune cells, and single-cell populations. Immu-Mela also enables integrative analysis of any two genomic features. We demonstrated the value of Immu-Mela by identifying known and novel genomic features associated with ICB response. In addition, Immu-Mela allows users to upload their data sets (unrestricted to any cancer types) and co-analyze with existing data to identify and validate signatures of interest. Immu-Mela reduces barriers between researchers and complex genomic data, facilitating discoveries in cancer immunotherapy.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

To understand the physiopathology and alterations due to the lysosomal accumulation resulting from enzymatic deficiencies and their secondary outcomes can improve the diagnosis and treatment of rare genetic diseases. This work presents a database for differentially expressed genes from different public MPS data. We developed our database, including 13 studies previously deposited in the GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The website is hosted in the UFRGS data processing center (CPD) and is available at <https://www.ufrgs.br/mpsbase/>. The site was constructed in PHP, and the analyses were performed in R. The organisms represented by the datasets are Canis lupus familiaris, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus. The user can search for the differentially expressed genes and ontologies by species, MPS type, or tissue type. For each comparison, a heatmap with the 50 top differentially expressed genes is available as well as dot plots for the 30 top ontologies divided by biological process, cellular component, KEGG pathways, and molecular function. This data is also fully available in tables. There are 54 possible comparisons involving about 5000 to 10,000 genes each. This website is the only specific database for MPS with filtering and presenting their results in a one-click approach to the best of our knowledge. The development of such analytical and automated strategies accessible to health professionals is essential for fostering MPS research.

They are ubiquitous genetic elements conserved across species and suspected to be involved in numerous cellular processes. MetamORF (https://metamorf.hb.univ-amu.fr/) aims to provide a repository of unique sORFs identified in the human and mouse genomes with both experimental and computational approaches. By gathering publicly available sORF data, normalizing them and summarizing redundant information, we were able to identify a total of 1‚Äâ162‚Äâ675 unique sORFs. Despite the usual characterization of ORFs as short, upstream or downstream, there is currently no clear consensus regarding the definition of these categories. Thus, the data have been reprocessed using a normalized nomenclature. MetamORF enables new analyses at locus, gene, transcript and ORF levels, which should offer the possibility to address new questions regarding sORF functions in the future. The repository is available through an user-friendly web interface, allowing easy browsing, visualization, filtering over multiple criteria and export possibilities. sORFs can be searched starting from a gene, a transcript and an ORF ID, looking in a genome area or browsing the whole repository for a species. The database content has also been made available through track hubs at UCSC Genome Browser. Finally, we demonstrated an enrichment of genes harboring upstream ORFs among genes expressed in response to reticular stress. Database URL  https://metamorf.hb.univ-amu.fr/.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Outcomes were extracted from Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves reported in 153 oncology Phase III clinical trial publications identified through a PubMed search of clinical trials in breast, lung, prostate and colorectal cancer, published between 2014 and 2016. For each trial that met our search criteria, we curated study-level information and digitized all reported KM curves with the software Digitizelt. We then used the digitized KM survival curves to estimate (possibly censored) patient-level time-to-event outcomes. Collections of time-to-event datasets from completed trials can be used to support the choice of appropriate trial designs for future clinical studies. Patient-level data allow investigators to tailor clinical trial designs to diseases and classes of treatments.

Currently, studies in rice (Oryza sativa) have mainly focused on the identification of GVs, while the functional annotation of GVs has not yet been systematically carried out. Here we present a functional impact map of GVs in rice. We curated haplotype information of 17,397,026 GVs from sequencing data of 4,726 rice accessions. We quantitatively evaluated the effects of missense mutations in coding regions in each haplotype based on the conservation of amino acid residues and obtained the effects of 918,848 non-redundant missense GVs. We also generated high-quality chromatin accessibility (CA) data from six representative rice tissues and used these data to train deep convolutional neural network models to predict the impacts of 5,067,405 GVs for CA in regulatory regions. We characterized the functional properties and tissue specificity of the effects of GVs and found that large-effect GVs in coding and regulatory regions might be subject to selection in different directions. We finally demonstrated how the functional impact map could be used to prioritize the causal variants in mapping populations. This impact map will be a useful resource for accelerating gene cloning and functional studies in rice and can be freely queried in RiceVarMap V2.0 (http://ricevarmap.ncpgr.cn).","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

34225788,A global overview of genetically interpretable multimorbidities among common diseases in the UK Biobank.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multimorbidities greatly increase the global health burdens, but the landscapes of their genetic risks have not been systematically investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>We used the hospital inpatient data of 385,335 patients in the UK Biobank to investigate the multimorbid relations among 439 common diseases. Post-GWAS analyses were performed to identify multimorbidity shared genetic risks at the genomic loci, network, as well as overall genetic architecture levels. We conducted network decomposition for the networks of genetically interpretable multimorbidities to detect the hub diseases and the involved molecules and functions in each module.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 11,285 multimorbidities among 439 common diseases were identified, and 46% of them were genetically interpretable at the loci, network, or overall genetic architecture levels. Multimorbidities affecting the same and different physiological systems displayed different patterns of the shared genetic components, with the former more likely to share loci-level genetic components while the latter more likely to share network-level genetic components. Moreover, both the loci- and network-level genetic components shared by multimorbidities converged on cell immunity, protein metabolism, and gene silencing. Furthermore, we found that the genetically interpretable multimorbidities tend to form network modules, mediated by hub diseases and featuring physiological categories. Finally, we showcased how hub diseases mediating the multimorbidity modules could help provide useful insights for the genetic contributors of multimorbidities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results provide a systematic resource for understanding the genetic predispositions of multimorbidities and indicate that hub diseases and converged molecules and functions may be the key for treating multimorbidities. We have created an online database that facilitates researchers and physicians to browse, search, or download these multimorbidities ( https://multimorbidity.comp-sysbio.org ).","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
34013642,Efficient study design to estimate population means with multiple measurement instruments.,"Outcomes from studies assessing exposure often use multiple measurements. In previous work, using a model first proposed by Buonoccorsi (1991), we showed that combining direct (eg, biomarkers) and indirect (eg, self-report) measurements provides a more accurate picture of true exposure than estimates obtained when using a single type of measurement. In this article, we propose a tool for efficient design of studies that include both direct and indirect measurements of a relevant outcome. Based on data from a pilot or preliminary study, the tool, which is available online as a shiny app at https://michalbitan.shinyapps.io/shinyApp/, can be used to compute: (1) the sample size required for a statistical power analysis, while optimizing the percent of participants who should provide direct measures of exposure (biomarkers) in addition to the indirect (self-report) measures provided by all participants; (2) the ideal number of replicates; and (3) the allocation of resources to intervention and control arms. In addition we show how to examine the sensitivity of results to underlying assumptions. We illustrate our analysis using studies of tobacco smoke exposure and nutrition. In these examples, a near-optimal allocation of the resources can be found even if the assumptions are not precise.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

While many neuropeptides have been identified in previous studies, the resulting data has not been structured to facilitate further analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), the main technology for high-throughput neuropeptide identification. Many neuropeptides are difficult to identify when searching MS/MS spectra against large protein databases because of their atypical lengths (e.g. shorter/longer than common tryptic peptides) and lack of tryptic residues to facilitate peptide ionization/fragmentation. NeuroPedia is a neuropeptide encyclopedia of peptide sequences (including genomic and taxonomic information) and spectral libraries of identified MS/MS spectra of homolog neuropeptides from multiple species. Searching neuropeptide MS/MS data against known NeuroPedia sequences will improve the sensitivity of database search tools. Moreover, the availability of neuropeptide spectral libraries will also enable the utilization of spectral library search tools, which are known to further improve the sensitivity of peptide identification. These will also reinforce the confidence in peptide identifications by enabling visual comparisons between new and previously identified neuropeptide MS/MS spectra.<h4>Availability</h4>http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software/NeuroPedia.html<h4>Contact</h4>bandeira@ucsd.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

22276777,miRdSNP: a database of disease-associated SNPs and microRNA target sites on 3'UTRs of human genes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can lead to the susceptibility and onset of diseases through their effects on gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Recent findings indicate that SNPs could create, destroy, or modify the efficiency of miRNA binding to the 3'UTR of a gene, resulting in gene dysregulation. With the rapidly growing number of published disease-associated SNPs (dSNPs), there is a strong need for resources specifically recording dSNPs on the 3'UTRs and their nucleotide distance from miRNA target sites. We present here miRdSNP, a database incorporating three important areas of dSNPs, miRNA target sites, and diseases.<h4>Description</h4>miRdSNP provides a unique database of dSNPs on the 3'UTRs of human genes manually curated from PubMed. The current release includes 786 dSNP-disease associations for 630 unique dSNPs and 204 disease types. miRdSNP annotates genes with experimentally confirmed targeting by miRNAs and indexes miRNA target sites predicted by TargetScan and PicTar as well as potential miRNA target sites newly generated by dSNPs. A robust web interface and search tools are provided for studying the proximity of miRNA binding sites to dSNPs in relation to human diseases. Searches can be dynamically filtered by gene name, miRBase ID, target prediction algorithm, disease, and any nucleotide distance between dSNPs and miRNA target sites. Results can be viewed at the sequence level showing the annotated locations for miRNA target sites and dSNPs on the entire 3'UTR sequences. The integration of dSNPs with the UCSC Genome browser is also supported.<h4>Conclusion</h4>miRdSNP provides a comprehensive data source of dSNPs and robust tools for exploring their distance from miRNA target sites on the 3'UTRs of human genes. miRdSNP enables researchers to further explore the molecular mechanism of gene dysregulation for dSNPs at posttranscriptional level. miRdSNP is freely available on the web at http://mirdsnp.ccr.buffalo.edu.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
22334387,The androgen receptor gene mutations database: 2012 update.,"The current version of the androgen receptor gene (AR) mutations database is described. A major change to the database is that the nomenclature and numbering scheme now conforms to all Human Genome Variation Society norms. The total number of reported mutations has risen from 605 to 1,029 since 2004. The database now contains a number of mutations that are associated with prostate cancer (CaP) treatment regimens, while the number of AR mutations found in CaP tissues has more than doubled from 76 to 159. In addition, in a number of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) and CaP cases, multiple mutations have been found within the same tissue samples. For the first time, we report on a disconnect within the AIS phenotype-genotype relationship among our own patient database, in that over 40% of our patients with a classic complete AIS or partial AIS phenotypes did not appear to have a mutation in their AR gene. The implications of this phenomenon on future locus-specific mutation database (LSDB) development are discussed, together with the concept that mutations can be associated with both loss- and gain-of-function, and the effect of multiple AR mutations within individuals. The database is available on the internet (http://androgendb.mcgill.ca), and a web-based LSDB with the variants using the Leiden Open Variation Database platform is available at http://www.lovd.nl/AR.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
22345505,ANAP: an integrated knowledge base for Arabidopsis protein interaction network analysis.,"Protein interactions are fundamental to the molecular processes occurring within an organism and can be utilized in network biology to help organize, simplify, and understand biological complexity. Currently, there are more than 10 publicly available Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) protein interaction databases. However, there are limitations with these databases, including different types of interaction evidence, a lack of defined standards for protein identifiers, differing levels of information, and, critically, a lack of integration between them. In this paper, we present an interactive bioinformatics Web tool, ANAP (Arabidopsis Network Analysis Pipeline), which serves to effectively integrate the different data sets and maximize access to available data. ANAP has been developed for Arabidopsis protein interaction integration and network-based study to facilitate functional protein network analysis. ANAP integrates 11 Arabidopsis protein interaction databases, comprising 201,699 unique protein interaction pairs, 15,208 identifiers (including 11,931 The Arabidopsis Information Resource Arabidopsis Genome Initiative codes), 89 interaction detection methods, 73 species that interact with Arabidopsis, and 6,161 references. ANAP can be used as a knowledge base for constructing protein interaction networks based on user input and supports both direct and indirect interaction analysis. It has an intuitive graphical interface allowing easy network visualization and provides extensive detailed evidence for each interaction. In addition, ANAP displays the gene and protein annotation in the generated interactive network with links to The Arabidopsis Information Resource, the AtGenExpress Visualization Tool, the Arabidopsis 1,001 Genomes GBrowse, the Protein Knowledgebase, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and the Ensembl Genome Browser to significantly aid functional network analysis.

22784567,SigCS base: an integrated genetic information resource for human cerebral stroke.,"<h4>Background</h4>To understand how stroke risk factors mechanistically contribute to stroke, the genetic components regulating each risk factor need to be integrated and evaluated with respect to biological function and through pathway-based algorithms. This resource will provide information to researchers studying the molecular and genetic causes of stroke in terms of genomic variants, genes, and pathways.<h4>Methods</h4>Reported genetic variants, gene structure, phenotypes, and literature information regarding stroke were collected and extracted from publicly available databases describing variants, genome, proteome, functional annotation, and disease subtypes. Stroke related candidate pathways and etiologic genes that participate significantly in risk were analyzed in terms of canonical pathways in public biological pathway databases. These efforts resulted in a relational database of genetic signals of cerebral stroke, SigCS base, which implements an effective web retrieval system.<h4>Results</h4>The current version of SigCS base documents 1943 non-redundant genes with 11472 genetic variants and 165 non-redundant pathways. The web retrieval system of SigCS base consists of two principal search flows, including: 1) a gene-based variant search using gene table browsing or a keyword search, and, 2) a pathway-based variant search using pathway table browsing. SigCS base is freely accessible at http://sysbio.kribb.re.kr/sigcs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SigCS base is an effective tool that can assist researchers in the identification of the genetic factors associated with stroke by utilizing existing literature information, selecting candidate genes and variants for experimental studies, and examining the pathways that contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
22836712,A comparative cellular and molecular biology of longevity database.,"Discovering key cellular and molecular traits that promote longevity is a major goal of aging and longevity research. One experimental strategy is to determine which traits have been selected during the evolution of longevity in naturally long-lived animal species. This comparative approach has been applied to lifespan research for nearly four decades, yielding hundreds of datasets describing aspects of cell and molecular biology hypothesized to relate to animal longevity. Here, we introduce a Comparative Cellular and Molecular Biology of Longevity Database, available at ( http://genomics.brocku.ca/ccmbl/ ), as a compendium of comparative cell and molecular data presented in the context of longevity. This open access database will facilitate the meta-analysis of amalgamated datasets using standardized maximum lifespan (MLSP) data (from AnAge). The first edition contains over 800 data records describing experimental measurements of cellular stress resistance, reactive oxygen species metabolism, membrane composition, protein homeostasis, and genome homeostasis as they relate to vertebrate species MLSP. The purpose of this review is to introduce the database and briefly demonstrate its use in the meta-analysis of combined datasets.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
22912585,Dissecting the gene network of dietary restriction to identify evolutionarily conserved pathways and new functional genes.,"Dietary restriction (DR), limiting nutrient intake from diet without causing malnutrition, delays the aging process and extends lifespan in multiple organisms. The conserved life-extending effect of DR suggests the involvement of fundamental mechanisms, although these remain a subject of debate. To help decipher the life-extending mechanisms of DR, we first compiled a list of genes that if genetically altered disrupt or prevent the life-extending effects of DR. We called these DR-essential genes and identified more than 100 in model organisms such as yeast, worms, flies, and mice. In order for other researchers to benefit from this first curated list of genes essential for DR, we established an online database called GenDR (http://genomics.senescence.info/diet/). To dissect the interactions of DR-essential genes and discover the underlying lifespan-extending mechanisms, we then used a variety of network and systems biology approaches to analyze the gene network of DR. We show that DR-essential genes are more conserved at the molecular level and have more molecular interactions than expected by chance. Furthermore, we employed a guilt-by-association method to predict novel DR-essential genes. In budding yeast, we predicted nine genes related to vacuolar functions; we show experimentally that mutations deleting eight of those genes prevent the life-extending effects of DR. Three of these mutants (OPT2, FRE6, and RCR2) had extended lifespan under ad libitum, indicating that the lack of further longevity under DR is not caused by a general compromise of fitness. These results demonstrate how network analyses of DR using GenDR can be used to make phenotypically relevant predictions. Moreover, gene-regulatory circuits reveal that the DR-induced transcriptional signature in yeast involves nutrient-sensing, stress responses and meiotic transcription factors. Finally, comparing the influence of gene expression changes during DR on the interactomes of multiple organisms led us to suggest that DR commonly suppresses translation, while stimulating an ancient reproduction-related process.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,tentative 1; Cannot be contributed to,
23093601,DoriC 5.0: an updated database of oriC regions in both bacterial and archaeal genomes.,"Replication of chromosomes is one of the central events in the cell cycle. Chromosome replication begins at specific sites, called origins of replication (oriCs), for all three domains of life. However, the origins of replication still remain unknown in a considerably large number of bacterial and archaeal genomes completely sequenced so far. The availability of increasing complete bacterial and archaeal genomes has created challenges and opportunities for identification of their oriCs in silico, as well as in vivo. Based on the Z-curve theory, we have developed a web-based system Ori-Finder to predict oriCs in bacterial genomes with high accuracy and reliability by taking advantage of comparative genomics, and the predicted oriC regions have been organized into an online database DoriC, which is publicly available at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/ since 2007. Five years after we constructed DoriC, the database has significant advances over the number of bacterial genomes, increasing about 4-fold. Additionally, oriC regions in archaeal genomes identified by in vivo experiments, as well as in silico analyses, have also been added to the database. Consequently, the latest release of DoriC contains oriCs for >1500 bacterial genomes and 81 archaeal genomes, respectively.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Molecular techniques have been developed for facilitating accurate, sensitive and low-cost diagnosis of these pathogens. Based on these techniques, diagnostic devices have been developed for a number of pathogens. More devices are needed for comprehensive coverage of medical pathogens. To facilitate the development of these devices, a database with integrated information about diagnostic methods, targets, and primers/probes for the known bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens is needed.

The angiosperms (flowering plants) are outstanding models in which to elucidate consequences of GD for higher eukaryotes, owing to their propensity for chromosomal duplication or even triplication in a few cases. Duplicated genome structures often require both intra- and inter-genome alignments to unravel their evolutionary history, also providing the means to deduce both obvious and otherwise-cryptic orthology, paralogy and other relationships among genes. The burgeoning sets of angiosperm genome sequences provide the foundation for a host of investigations into the functional and evolutionary consequences of gene and GD. To provide genome alignments from a single resource based on uniform standards that have been validated by empirical studies, we built the Plant Genome Duplication Database (PGDD; freely available at http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/), a web service providing synteny information in terms of colinearity between chromosomes.

OncomiRs are microRNAs (miRNAs) that have been frequently shown to be deregulated in cancer. However, although several oncomiRs have been identified and characterized, there is as yet no comprehensive compilation of this data which has rendered it underutilized by cancer biologists. There is therefore an unmet need in generating bioinformatic platforms to speed the identification of novel therapeutic targets.<h4>Description</h4>We describe here OncomiRdbB, a comprehensive database of oncomiRs mined from different existing databases for mouse and humans along with novel oncomiRs that we have validated in human breast cancer samples. The database also lists their respective predicted targets, identified using miRanda, along with their IDs, sequences, chromosome location and detailed description. This database facilitates querying by search strings including microRNA name, sequence, accession number, target genes and organisms.

24466021,CoryneBase: Corynebacterium genomic resources and analysis tools at your fingertips.,"Corynebacteria are used for a wide variety of industrial purposes but some species are associated with human diseases. With increasing number of corynebacterial genomes having been sequenced, comparative analysis of these strains may provide better understanding of their biology, phylogeny, virulence and taxonomy that may lead to the discoveries of beneficial industrial strains or contribute to better management of diseases. To facilitate the ongoing research of corynebacteria, a specialized central repository and analysis platform for the corynebacterial research community is needed to host the fast-growing amount of genomic data and facilitate the analysis of these data. Here we present CoryneBase, a genomic database for Corynebacterium with diverse functionality for the analysis of genomes aimed to provide: (1) annotated genome sequences of Corynebacterium where 165,918 coding sequences and 4,180 RNAs can be found in 27 species; (2) access to comprehensive Corynebacterium data through the use of advanced web technologies for interactive web interfaces; and (3) advanced bioinformatic analysis tools consisting of standard BLAST for homology search, VFDB BLAST for sequence homology search against the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB), Pairwise Genome Comparison (PGC) tool for comparative genomic analysis, and a newly designed Pathogenomics Profiling Tool (PathoProT) for comparative pathogenomic analysis.

24558441,Human transporter database: comprehensive knowledge and discovery tools in the human transporter genes.,"Transporters are essential in homeostatic exchange of endogenous and exogenous substances at the systematic, organic, cellular, and subcellular levels. Gene mutations of transporters are often related to pharmacogenetics traits. Recent developments in high throughput technologies on genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics allow in depth studies of transporter genes in normal cellular processes and diverse disease conditions. The flood of high throughput data have resulted in urgent need for an updated knowledgebase with curated, organized, and annotated human transporters in an easily accessible way. Using a pipeline with the combination of automated keywords query, sequence similarity search and manual curation on transporters, we collected 1,555 human non-redundant transporter genes to develop the Human Transporter Database (HTD) (http://htd.cbi.pku.edu.cn). Based on the extensive annotations, global properties of the transporter genes were illustrated, such as expression patterns and polymorphisms in relationships with their ligands. We noted that the human transporters were enriched in many fundamental biological processes such as oxidative phosphorylation and cardiac muscle contraction, and significantly associated with Mendelian and complex diseases such as epilepsy and sudden infant death syndrome. Overall, HTD provides a well-organized interface to facilitate research communities to search detailed molecular and genetic information of transporters for development of personalized medicine.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
24651967,OncomiRDB: a database for the experimentally verified oncogenic and tumor-suppressive microRNAs.,"<h4>Summary</h4>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small regulatory RNAs, play important roles in cancer initiation, progression and therapy. MiRNAs are found to regulate diverse cancer-related processes by targeting a large set of oncogenic and tumor-suppressive genes. To establish a high-confidence reference resource for studying the miRNA-regulated target genes and cellular processes in cancer, we manually curated 2259 entries of cancer-related miRNA regulations with direct experimental evidence from ~9000 abstracts, covering more than 300 miRNAs and 829 target genes across 25 cancer tissues. A web-based portal named oncomiRDB, which provides both graphical and text-based interfaces, was developed for easily browsing and searching all the annotations. It should be a useful resource for both the computational analysis and experimental study on miRNA regulatory networks and functions in cancer.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/oncomirdb/<h4>Contact</h4>jgu@tsinghua.edu.cn<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
24712981,SFGD: a comprehensive platform for mining functional information from soybean transcriptome data and its use in identifying acyl-lipid metabolism pathways.,"<h4>Background</h4>Soybean (Glycine max L.) is one of the world's most important leguminous crops producing high-quality protein and oil. Increasing the relative oil concentration in soybean seeds is many researchers' goal, but a complete analysis platform of functional annotation for the genes involved in the soybean acyl-lipid pathway is still lacking. Following the success of soybean whole-genome sequencing, functional annotation has become a major challenge for the scientific community. Whole-genome transcriptome analysis is a powerful way to predict genes with biological functions. It is essential to build a comprehensive analysis platform for integrating soybean whole-genome sequencing data, the available transcriptome data and protein information. This platform could also be used to identify acyl-lipid metabolism pathways.<h4>Description</h4>In this study, we describe our construction of the Soybean Functional Genomics Database (SFGD) using Generic Genome Browser (Gbrowse) as the core platform. We integrated microarray expression profiling with 255 samples from 14 groups' experiments and mRNA-seq data with 30 samples from four groups' experiments, including spatial and temporal transcriptome data for different soybean development stages and environmental stresses. The SFGD includes a gene co-expression regulatory network containing 23,267 genes and 1873 miRNA-target pairs, and a group of acyl-lipid pathways containing 221 enzymes and more than 1550 genes. The SFGD also provides some key analysis tools, i.e. BLAST search, expression pattern search and cis-element significance analysis, as well as gene ontology information search and single nucleotide polymorphism display.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The SFGD is a comprehensive database integrating genome and transcriptome data, and also for soybean acyl-lipid metabolism pathways. It provides useful toolboxes for biologists to improve the accuracy and robustness of soybean functional genomics analysis, further improving understanding of gene regulatory networks for effective crop improvement. The SFGD is publically accessible at http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/SFGD/, with all data available for downloading.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
24855436,Polytraits: A database on biological traits of marine polychaetes.,"The study of ecosystem functioning - the role which organisms play in an ecosystem - is becoming increasingly important in marine ecological research. The functional structure of a community can be represented by a set of functional traits assigned to behavioural, reproductive and morphological characteristics. The collection of these traits from the literature is however a laborious and time-consuming process, and gaps of knowledge and restricted availability of literature are a common problem. Trait data are not yet readily being shared by research communities, and even if they are, a lack of trait data repositories and standards for data formats leads to the publication of trait information in forms which cannot be processed by computers. This paper describes Polytraits (http://polytraits.lifewatchgreece.eu), a database on biological traits of marine polychaetes (bristle worms, Polychaeta: Annelida). At present, the database contains almost 20,000 records on morphological, behavioural and reproductive characteristics of more than 1,000 marine polychaete species, all referenced by literature sources. All data can be freely accessed through the project website in different ways and formats, both human-readable and machine-readable, and have been submitted to the Encyclopedia of Life for archival and integration with trait information from other sources.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

This is due to the great diversity of these organisms and their wide-ranging capabilities. Genomics tools are essential for taking advantage of these """"free lessons"""" of nature. However, genomics and transcriptomics are challenging in emerging model systems. Here, we present SeaBase, a tool for helping to meet these needs. Specifically, SeaBase provides a platform for sharing and searching transcriptome data. More importantly, SeaBase will support a growing number of tools for inferring gene network mechanisms. The first dataset available on SeaBase is a developmental transcriptomic profile of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa, Cnidaria). Additional datasets are currently being prepared and we are aiming to expand SeaBase to include user-supplied data for any number of marine and aquatic organisms, thereby supporting many potentially new models for gene network studies.

However, identifying an appropriate growth medium for a novel isolate remains a challenging task. Even organisms with sequenced and annotated genomes can be difficult to grow, despite our ability to build genome-scale metabolic networks that connect genomic data with metabolic function. The scientific literature is scattered with information about defined growth media used successfully for cultivating a wide variety of organisms, but to date there exists no centralized repository to inform efforts to cultivate less characterized organisms by bridging the gap between genomic data and compound composition for growth media. Here we present MediaDB, a manually curated database of defined media that have been used for cultivating organisms with sequenced genomes, with an emphasis on organisms with metabolic network models. The database is accessible online, can be queried by keyword searches or downloaded in its entirety, and can generate exportable individual media formulation files. The data assembled in MediaDB facilitate comparative studies of organism growth media, serve as a starting point for formulating novel growth media, and contribute to formulating media for in silico investigation of metabolic networks.

25551368,PD_NGSAtlas: a reference database combining next-generation sequencing epigenomic and transcriptomic data for psychiatric disorders.,"<h4>Background</h4>Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) are projected to lead the global disease burden within the next decade. Several lines of evidence suggest that epigenetic- or genetic-mediated dysfunction is frequently present in these disorders. To date, the inheritance patterns have been complicated by the problem of integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic factors that have yet to be elucidated. Therefore, there is a need to build a comprehensive database for storing epigenomic and transcriptomic data relating to psychiatric disorders.<h4>Description</h4>We have developed the PD_NGSAtlas, which focuses on the efficient storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data based on next-generation sequencing and on the quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders. The current release of the PD_NGSAtlas contains 43 DNA methylation profiles and 37 transcription profiles detected by MeDIP-Seq and RNA-Seq, respectively, in two distinct brain regions and peripheral blood of SZ, BP and non-psychiatric controls. In addition to these data that were generated in-house, we have included, and will continue to include, published DNA methylation and gene expression data from other research groups, with a focus on psychiatric disorders. A flexible query engine has been developed for the acquisition of methylation profiles and transcription profiles for special genes or genomic regions of interest of the selected samples. Furthermore, the PD_NGSAtlas offers online tools for identifying aberrantly methylated and expressed events involved in psychiatric disorders. A genome browser has been developed to provide integrative and detailed views of multidimensional data in a given genomic context, which can help researchers understand molecular mechanisms from epigenetic and transcriptional perspectives. Moreover, users can download the methylation and transcription data for further analyses.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The PD_NGSAtlas aims to provide storage of epigenomic and transcriptomic data as well as quantitative analyses of epigenetic and transcriptional alterations involved in psychiatric disorders. The PD_NGSAtlas will be a valuable data resource and will enable researchers to investigate the pathophysiology and aetiology of disease in detail.

25922515,The Fossil Calibration Database-A New Resource for Divergence Dating.,"Fossils provide the principal basis for temporal calibrations, which are critical to the accuracy of divergence dating analyses. Translating fossil data into minimum and maximum bounds for calibrations is the most important-often least appreciated-step of divergence dating. Properly justified calibrations require the synthesis of phylogenetic, paleontological, and geological evidence and can be difficult for nonspecialists to formulate. The dynamic nature of the fossil record (e.g., new discoveries, taxonomic revisions, updates of global or local stratigraphy) requires that calibration data be updated continually lest they become obsolete. Here, we announce the Fossil Calibration Database (http://fossilcalibrations.org), a new open-access resource providing vetted fossil calibrations to the scientific community. Calibrations accessioned into this database are based on individual fossil specimens and follow best practices for phylogenetic justification and geochronological constraint. The associated Fossil Calibration Series, a calibration-themed publication series at Palaeontologia Electronica, will serve as a key pipeline for peer-reviewed calibrations to enter the database.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
26061870,Human Chromosome Y and Haplogroups; introducing YDHS Database.,"<h4>Background</h4>As the high throughput sequencing efforts generate more biological information, scientists from different disciplines are interpreting the polymorphisms that make us unique. In addition, there is an increasing trend in general public to research their own genealogy, find distant relatives and to know more about their biological background. Commercial vendors are providing analyses of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomal markers for such purposes. Clearly, an easy-to-use free interface to the existing data on the identified variants would be in the interest of general public and professionals less familiar with the field. Here we introduce a novel metadatabase YDHS that aims to provide such an interface for Y-chromosomal DNA (Y-DNA) haplogroups and sequence variants.<h4>Methods</h4>The database uses ISOGG Y-DNA tree as the source of mutations and haplogroups and by using genomic positions of the mutations the database links them to genes and other biological entities. YDHS contains analysis tools for deeper Y-SNP analysis.<h4>Results</h4>YDHS addresses the shortage of Y-DNA related databases. We have tested our database using a set of different cases from literature ranging from infertility to autism. The database is at http://www.semanticgen.net/ydhs<h4>Conclusions</h4>Y-chromosomal DNA (Y-DNA) haplogroups and sequence variants have not been in the scientific limelight, excluding certain specialized fields like forensics, mainly because there is not much freely available information or it is scattered in different sources. However, as we have demonstrated Y-SNPs do play a role in various cases on the haplogroup level and it is possible to create a free Y-DNA dedicated bioinformatics resource.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Therefore, understanding of miRNA regulatory networks is essential in order to modulate the functions of a miRNA. The focus of several existing databases is to provide information on specific aspects of miRNA regulation. However, an integrated resource on the miRNA regulome is currently not available to facilitate the exploration and understanding of miRNA regulomics. miRegulome attempts to bridge this gap. The current version of miRegulome v1.0 provides details on the entire regulatory modules of miRNAs altered in response to chemical treatments and transcription factors, based on validated data manually curated from published literature. Modules of miRegulome (upstream regulators, downstream targets, miRNA regulated pathways, functions, diseases, etc) are hyperlinked to an appropriate external resource and are displayed visually to provide a comprehensive understanding. Four analysis tools are incorporated to identify relationships among different modules based on user specified datasets. miRegulome and its tools are helpful in understanding the biology of miRNAs and will also facilitate the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutics.

Although such collections of naturally occurring language errors are invaluable for a number of reasons, the process of collecting various types of speech errors presents many challenges to the researcher interested in building such a collection, among them a significant investment of time and effort to obtain a sufficient number of examples to enable statistical analysis. Here we describe a freely accessible website http://spedi.ku.edu that helps users document slips of the tongue, slips of the ear, and tip of the tongue states that they experience firsthand or observe in others. The documented errors are amassed, and made available for other users to analyze, thereby distributing the time and effort involved in collecting errors across a large number of individuals instead of saddling the lone researcher, and facilitating distribution of the collection to other researchers. This approach also addresses some issues related to data curation that hampered previous error collections, and enables the collection to continue to grow over a longer period of time than previous collections.

26387108,The Protein Ensemble Database.,"The scientific community's major conceptual notion of structural biology has recently shifted in emphasis from the classical structure-function paradigm due to the emergence of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). As opposed to their folded cousins, these proteins are defined by the lack of a stable 3D fold and a high degree of inherent structural heterogeneity that is closely tied to their function. Due to their flexible nature, solution techniques such as small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are particularly well-suited for characterizing their biophysical properties. Computationally derived structural ensembles based on such experimental measurements provide models of the conformational sampling displayed by these proteins, and they may offer valuable insights into the functional consequences of inherent flexibility. The Protein Ensemble Database (http://pedb.vib.be) is the first openly accessible, manually curated online resource storing the ensemble models, protocols used during the calculation procedure, and underlying primary experimental data derived from SAXS and/or NMR measurements. By making this previously inaccessible data freely available to researchers, this novel resource is expected to promote the development of more advanced modelling methodologies, facilitate the design of standardized calculation protocols, and consequently lead to a better understanding of how function arises from the disordered state.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

This provides the scientific community with the necessary information to derive trends about privileged physicochemical properties and chemotypes that maximize the likelihood of promoting a given chemical probe to the most advanced stages of development. To this end we have developed iPPI-DB (freely accessible at http://www.ippidb.cdithem.fr), a database that contains the structure, some physicochemical characteristics, the pharmacological data and the profile of the PPI targets of several hundreds modulators of protein-protein interactions. iPPI-DB is accessible through a web application and can be queried according to two general approaches: using physicochemical/pharmacological criteria; or by chemical similarity to a user-defined structure input. In both cases the results are displayed as a sortable and exportable datasheet with links to external databases such as Uniprot, PubMed. Furthermore each compound in the table has a link to an individual ID card that contains its physicochemical and pharmacological profile derived from iPPI-DB data.

In dbEM, modifiers are classified on functional basis and comprise of 48 histone methyl transferases, 33 chromatin remodelers and 31 histone demethylases. dbEM maintains the genomic information like mutations, copy number variation and gene expression in thousands of tumor samples, cancer cell lines and healthy samples. This information is obtained from public resources viz. COSMIC, CCLE and 1000-genome project. Gene essentiality data retrieved from COLT database further highlights the importance of various epigenetic proteins for cancer survival. We have also reported the sequence profiles, tertiary structures and post-translational modifications of these epigenetic proteins in cancer. It also contains information of 54 drug molecules against different epigenetic proteins. A wide range of tools have been integrated in dbEM e.g. Search, BLAST, Alignment and Profile based prediction. In our analysis, we found that epigenetic proteins DNMT3A, HDAC2, KDM6A, and TET2 are highly mutated in variety of cancers. We are confident that dbEM will be very useful in cancer research particularly in the field of epigenetic proteins based cancer therapeutics.

Both in normal and aberrant activities, miRNAs contribute to a recurring paradigm of cellular behaviors in pathological settings, especially in gerontology. Autophagy, a multi-step lysosomal degradation process with function to degrade long-lived proteins and damaged organelles, has significant impact on gerontology. Thus, elucidating how miRNAs participate in autophagy may enlarge the scope of miRNA in autophagy and facilitate researches in gerontology.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Herein, based upon the published studies, predicted targets and gerontology-related diseases, we constructed a web resource named Gerontology-Autophagic-MicroRNA Database (GAMDB) (http://gamdb.liu-lab.com/index.php), which contained 836 autophagy-related miRNAs, 197 targeted genes/proteins and 56 aging-related diseases such as Parkinson' disease, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease.<h4>Results and conclusion</h4>We made use of large amounts of data to elucidate the intricate relationships between microRNA-regulated autophagic mechanisms and gerontology.

The first step was to bioinformatically identify all E3 ligase genes coded by the human genome. The 377 E3 ubiquitin ligases identified in the human genome, consisting predominant of HECT, RING, and U-box proteins, have been used to create a publically accessible and downloadable online database (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/E3-ligases/). We also curated a second database of E3 ligase accessory proteins that included BTB domain proteins, cullins, SOCS-box proteins, and F-box proteins. Using Bayes' theorem to integrate information from multiple large-scale proteomic and transcriptomic datasets, we ranked these 377 E3 ligases with respect to their probability of interaction with AQP2. Application of Bayes' rule identified the E3 ligases most likely to interact with AQP2 as (in order of probability): NEDD4 and NEDD4L (tied for first), AMFR, STUB1, ITCH, ZFPL1. Significantly, the two E3 ligases tied for top rank have also been studied extensively in the reductionist literature as regulatory proteins in renal tubule epithelia. The concordance of conclusions from reductionist and systems-level data provides strong motivation for further studies of the roles of NEDD4 and NEDD4L in the regulation of AQP2 protein turnover.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
27242836,VESPUCCI: Exploring Patterns of Gene Expression in Grapevine.,"Large-scale transcriptional studies aim to decipher the dynamic cellular responses to a stimulus, like different environmental conditions. In the era of high-throughput omics biology, the most used technologies for these purposes are microarray and RNA-Seq, whose data are usually required to be deposited in public repositories upon publication. Such repositories have the enormous potential to provide a comprehensive view of how different experimental conditions lead to expression changes, by comparing gene expression across all possible measured conditions. Unfortunately, this task is greatly impaired by differences among experimental platforms that make direct comparisons difficult. In this paper, we present the Vitis Expression Studies Platform Using COLOMBOS Compendia Instances (VESPUCCI), a gene expression compendium for grapevine which was built by adapting an approach originally developed for bacteria, and show how it can be used to investigate complex gene expression patterns. We integrated nearly all publicly available microarray and RNA-Seq expression data: 1608 gene expression samples from 10 different technological platforms. Each sample has been manually annotated using a controlled vocabulary developed ad hoc to ensure both human readability and computational tractability. Expression data in the compendium can be visually explored using several tools provided by the web interface or can be programmatically accessed using the REST interface. VESPUCCI is freely accessible at http://vespucci.colombos.fmach.it.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
27451428,SZDB: A Database for Schizophrenia Genetic Research.,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a debilitating brain disorder with a complex genetic architecture. Genetic studies, especially recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified multiple variants (loci) conferring risk to SZ. However, how to efficiently extract meaningful biological information from bulk genetic findings of SZ remains a major challenge. There is a pressing need to integrate multiple layers of data from various sources, eg, genetic findings from GWAS, copy number variations (CNVs), association and linkage studies, gene expression, protein-protein interaction (PPI), co-expression, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data, to provide a comprehensive resource to facilitate the translation of genetic findings into SZ molecular diagnosis and mechanism study. Here we developed the SZDB database (http://www.szdb.org/), a comprehensive resource for SZ research. SZ genetic data, gene expression data, network-based data, brain eQTL data, and SNP function annotation information were systematically extracted, curated and deposited in SZDB. In-depth analyses and systematic integration were performed to identify top prioritized SZ genes and enriched pathways. Multiple types of data from various layers of SZ research were systematically integrated and deposited in SZDB. In-depth data analyses and integration identified top prioritized SZ genes and enriched pathways. We further showed that genes implicated in SZ are highly co-expressed in human brain and proteins encoded by the prioritized SZ risk genes are significantly interacted. The user-friendly SZDB provides high-confidence candidate variants and genes for further functional characterization. More important, SZDB provides convenient online tools for data search and browse, data integration, and customized data analyses.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,tentative 1; Clinical type data.

27841751,A public database of macromolecular diffraction experiments.,"The low reproducibility of published experimental results in many scientific disciplines has recently garnered negative attention in scientific journals and the general media. Public transparency, including the availability of `raw' experimental data, will help to address growing concerns regarding scientific integrity. Macromolecular X-ray crystallography has led the way in requiring the public dissemination of atomic coordinates and a wealth of experimental data, making the field one of the most reproducible in the biological sciences. However, there remains no mandate for public disclosure of the original diffraction data. The Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromolecular Crystallography (IRRMC) has been developed to archive raw data from diffraction experiments and, equally importantly, to provide related metadata. Currently, the database of our resource contains data from 2920 macromolecular diffraction experiments (5767 data sets), accounting for around 3% of all depositions in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with their corresponding partially curated metadata. IRRMC utilizes distributed storage implemented using a federated architecture of many independent storage servers, which provides both scalability and sustainability. The resource, which is accessible via the web portal at http://www.proteindiffraction.org, can be searched using various criteria. All data are available for unrestricted access and download. The resource serves as a proof of concept and demonstrates the feasibility of archiving raw diffraction data and associated metadata from X-ray crystallographic studies of biological macromolecules. The goal is to expand this resource and include data sets that failed to yield X-ray structures in order to facilitate collaborative efforts that will improve protein structure-determination methods and to ensure the availability of `orphan' data left behind for various reasons by individual investigators and/or extinct structural genomics projects.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

In the updated YM500v3 database (http://ngs.ym.edu.tw/ym500/) presented herein, we not only focus on miRNAs but also on other functional small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), such as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). There is growing knowledge of the role of sncRNAs in gene regulation and tumorigenesis. We have also incorporated >10 000 cancer-related RNA-seq and >3000 more smRNA-seq data sets into the YM500v3 database. Furthermore, there are two main new sections, 'Survival' and 'Cancer', in this updated version. The 'Survival' section provides the survival analysis results in all cancer types or in a user-defined group of samples for a specific sncRNA. The 'Cancer' section provides the results of differential expression analyses, miRNA-gene interactions and cancer miRNA-related pathways. In the 'Expression' section, sncRNA expression profiles across cancer and sample types are newly provided. Cancer-related sncRNAs hold potential for both biotech applications and basic research.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
27980519,<i>ContaMiner</i> and ContaBase: a webserver and database for early identification of unwantedly crystallized protein contaminants.,"Solving the phase problem in protein X-ray crystallography relies heavily on the identity of the crystallized protein, especially when molecular replacement (MR) methods are used. Yet, it is not uncommon that a contaminant crystallizes instead of the protein of interest. Such contaminants may be proteins from the expression host organism, protein fusion tags or proteins added during the purification steps. Many contaminants co-purify easily, crystallize and give good diffraction data. Identification of contaminant crystals may take time, since the presence of the contaminant is unexpected and its identity unknown. A webserver (<i>ContaMiner</i>) and a contaminant database (ContaBase) have been established, to allow fast MR-based screening of crystallographic data against currently 62 known contaminants. The web-based <i>ContaMiner</i> (available at http://strube.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/contaminer/) currently produces results in 5 min to 4 h. The program is also available in a github repository and can be installed locally. <i>ContaMiner</i> enables screening of novel crystals at synchrotron beamlines, and it would be valuable as a routine safety check for 'crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis' publications. Thus, in addition to potentially saving X-ray crystallographers much time and effort, <i>ContaMiner</i> might considerably lower the risk of publishing erroneous data.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Grouping and prioritizing a large number of genes for further analysis can be a time-consuming challenge. In 2009 we developed a web-based user interface, GExplore, to assist with large-scale data-mining related to gene function in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. The underlying database contained information about <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> genes and proteins including domain organization of the proteins, phenotypic descriptions, expression data and Gene Ontology Consortium annotations. These data enable users to quickly obtain an overview of biological and biochemical functions of a large number of genes at once. Since its inception the underlying database has been updated and expanded significantly. Here we describe the current version of GExplore 1.4, documenting the changes since the original release. GExplore 1.4 now contains information about the domain organization of the proteomes of 9 nematode species, can display the location of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> mutations with respect to the domain organization of the proteins, and includes stage-specific RNAseq gene expression data generated by the modENCODE project. The underlying database has been reorganized to facilitate independent updates of the different parts of the database and to allow the addition of novel data sets in the future.

28149703,Expanding our understanding of the trade in marine aquarium animals.,"The trade of live marine animals for home and public aquaria has grown into a major global industry. Millions of marine fishes and invertebrates are removed from coral reefs and associated habitats each year. The majority are imported into the United States, with the remainder sent to Europe, Japan, and a handful of other countries. Despite the recent growth and diversification of the aquarium trade, to date, data collection is not mandatory, and hence comprehensive information on species volume and diversity is lacking. This lack of information makes it impossible to study trade pathways. Without species-specific volume and diversity data, it is unclear how importing and exporting governments can oversee this industry effectively or how sustainability should be encouraged. To expand our knowledge and understanding of the trade, and to effectively communicate this new understanding, we introduce the publically-available Marine Aquarium Biodiversity and Trade Flow online database (https://www.aquariumtradedata.org/). This tool was created to communicate the volume and diversity of marine fishes and/or invertebrates imported into the US over three complete years (2008, 2009, and 2011) and three partial years (2000, 2004, 2005). To create this tool, invoices pertaining to shipments of live marine fishes and invertebrates were scanned and analyzed for species name, species quantities, country of origin, port of entry, and city of import destination. Here we focus on the analysis of the later three years of data and also produce an estimate for the entirety of 2000, 2004, and 2005. The three-year aggregate totals (2008, 2009, 2011) indicate that just under 2,300 fish and 725 invertebrate species were imported into the US cumulatively, although just under 1,800 fish and 550 invertebrate species were traded annually. Overall, the total number of live marine animals decreased between 2008 and 2011. In 2008, 2009, and 2011, the total number of individual fish (8.2, 7.3, and 6.9 million individuals) and invertebrates (4.2, 3.7, and 3.6 million individuals) assessed by analyzing the invoice data are roughly 60% of the total volumes recorded through the Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS) dataset. Using these complete years, we back-calculated the number of individuals of both fishes and invertebrates imported in 2000, 2004, and 2005. These estimates (9.3, 10.8, and 11.2 million individual fish per year) were consistent with the three years of complete data. We also use these data to understand the global trade in two species (Banggai cardinalfish, <i>Pterapogon kauderni</i>, and orange clownfish, <i>Amphiprion ocellaris</i> / <i>percula</i>) recently considered for Endangered Species Act listing. Aquariumtradedata.org can help create more effective management plans for the traded species, and ideally could be implemented at key trade ports to better assess the global trade of aquatic wildlife.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
28203233,Exo-miRExplorer: A Comprehensive Resource for Exploring and Comparatively Analyzing Exogenous MicroRNAs.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory RNAs that play important roles in animals, plants, and viruses. Deep-sequencing technology has been widely adopted in miRNA investigations. However, it is still a big mysterious why nearly all sequencing data contain miRNA sequences from exogenous species, called exo-miRNAs. In this study, we developed a novel platform, exo-miRExplorer, for mining and identifying exo-miRNAs from high-throughput small RNA sequencing experiments which originated from tissues and cell lines of multiple organisms. Thousands of exo-miRNAs are characterized with their expression abundance, the RNA families, original organisms and the sequencing platforms presented in exo-miRExplorer. Subsequently, we used exo-miRExplorer to perform further analysis. Comparative analysis of the exo-miRNAs between different sequencing datasets revealed significant correlation of exo-miRNAs between experiments in the same study. The plant-derived exo-miRNAs analysis provided robust evidence for non-diet source of exo-miRNAs. Virus-derived exo-miRNA analysis showed that pathogen RNAs could transfer to host cells and exist in deep-sequencing result at abundance level. In conclusion, exo-miRExplorer provides users with an integrative resource to facilitate detection and analysis of exo-miRNAs. exo-miRExplorer is available at the following URL: http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/exomiRDB/.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

While results from rodent malaria transfections have been curated and systematised, empowering large-scale analysis, phenotypic data from human malaria parasite transfections currently exists as individual reports scattered across a the literature. To facilitate systematic analysis of published experimental genetic data across <i>Plasmodium</i> species, we have built PhenoPlasm ( http://www.phenoplasm.org), a database of phenotypes generated by transfection experiments in all <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites. The site provides a simple interface linking citation-backed <i>Plasmodium</i> reverse-genetic phenotypes to gene IDs. The database has been populated with phenotypic data on 367 <i>P. falciparum</i> genes, curated from 176 individual publications, as well as existing data on rodent <i>Plasmodium</i> species from RMgmDB and PlasmoGEM. This is the first time that all available data on <i>P. falciparum</i> transfection experiments has been brought together in a single place. These data are presented using ortholog mapping to allow a researcher interested in a gene in one species to see results across other <i>Plasmodium</i> species. The collaborative nature of the database enables any researcher to add new phenotypes as they are discovered. As an example of database utility, we use the currently available datasets to identify RAP (RNA-binding domain abundant in Apicomplexa)-domain containing proteins as crucial to parasite survival.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

With the advantages of next generation sequencing technologies, genome sequences for many date palm cultivars have been released recently. Short sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be identified from these genomic data, and have been proven to be very useful biomarkers in plant genome analysis and breeding. Results: Here, we first improved the date palm genome assembly using 130X of HiSeq data generated in our lab. Then 246,445 SSRs (214,901 SSRs and 31,544 compound SSRs) were annotated in this genome assembly; among the SSRs, mononucleotide SSRs (58.92%) were the most abundant, followed by di- (29.92%), tri- (8.14%), tetra- (2.47%), penta- (0.36%), and hexa-nucleotide SSRs (0.19%). The high-quality PCR primer pairs were designed for most (174,497; 70.81% out of total) SSRs. We also annotated 6,375,806 SNPs with raw read depth=3 in 90% cultivars. To further reduce false positive SNPs, we only kept 5,572,650 (87.40% out of total) SNPs with at least 20% cultivars support for downstream analyses. The high-quality PCR primer pairs were also obtained for 4,177,778 (65.53%) SNPs. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among the 62 cultivars using these variants and found that they can be divided into three clusters, namely North Africa, Egypt - Sudan, and Middle East - South Asian, with Egypt - Sudan being the admixture of North Africa and Middle East - South Asian cultivars; we further confirmed these clusters using principal component analysis. Moreover, 34,346 SSRs and 4,177,778 SNPs with PCR primers were assigned to shared cultivars for cultivar classification and diversity analysis. All these SSRs, SNPs and their classification are available in our database, and can be used for cultivar identification, comparison, and molecular breeding. Conclusion:DRDB is a comprehensive genomic resource database of date palm. It can serve as a bioinformatics platform for date palm genomics, genetics, and molecular breeding.

The accuracy of quantification, however, has been problematic as not all peptides are suitable for quantification. Several methods and tools have been developed to identify peptides that response well in mass spectrometry and they are mainly based on predictive models, and rarely consider the linearity of the response curve, limiting the accuracy and applicability of the methods. An alternative solution is to select empirically superior peptides that offer satisfactory MS response intensity and linearity in a wide dynamic range of peptide concentration.<h4>Results</h4>We constructed a reference database for proteome quantification based on experimental mass spectrum response curves. The intensity and dynamic range of over 2 647 773 transitions from 121 318 peptides were obtained from a set of dilution experiments, covering 11 040 gene products. These transitions and peptides were evaluated and presented in a database named SCRIPT-MAP. We showed that the best-responder (BR) peptide approach for quantification based on SCRIPT-MAP database is robust, repeatable and accurate in proteome-scale protein quantification. This study provides a reference database as well as a peptides/transitions selection method for quantitative proteomics.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>SCRIPT-MAP database is available at http://www.firmiana.org/responders/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
29662024,"PKIDB: A Curated, Annotated and Updated Database of Protein Kinase Inhibitors in Clinical Trials.","The number of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs) approved worldwide continues to grow steadily, with 39 drugs approved in the period between 2001 and January 2018. PKIs on the market have been the subject of many reviews, and structure-property relationships specific to this class of drugs have been inferred. However, the large number of PKIs under development is often overlooked. In this paper, we present PKIDB (Protein Kinase Inhibitor Database), a monthly-updated database gathering approved PKIs as well as PKIs currently in clinical trials. The database compiles currently 180 inhibitors ranging from phase 0 to 4 clinical trials along with annotations extracted from seven public resources. The distribution and property ranges of standard physicochemical properties are presented. They can be used as filters to better prioritize compound selection for future screening campaigns. Interestingly, more than one-third of the kinase inhibitors violate at least one Lipinski's rule. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals that Type-II inhibitors are mapped to a distinct chemical space as compared to orally administrated drugs as well as to other types of kinase inhibitors. Using a Principal Moment of Inertia (PMI) analysis, we show that PKIs under development tend to explore new shape territories as compared to approved PKIs. In order to facilitate the analysis of the protein space, the kinome tree has been annotated with all protein kinases being targeted by PKIs.

29743053,PDXliver: a database of liver cancer patient derived xenograft mouse models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and characterized by heterogeneity and drug resistance. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been widely used in cancer research because they reproduce the characteristics of original tumors. However, the current studies of liver cancer PDX mice are scattered and the number of available PDX models are too small to represent the heterogeneity of liver cancer patients. To improve this situation and to complement available PDX models related resources, here we constructed a comprehensive database, PDXliver, to integrate and analyze liver cancer PDX models.<h4>Description</h4>Currently, PDXliver contains 116 PDX models from Chinese liver cancer patients, 51 of them were established by the in-house PDX platform and others were curated from the public literatures. These models are annotated with complete information, including clinical characteristics of patients, genome-wide expression profiles, germline variations, somatic mutations and copy number alterations. Analysis of expression subtypes and mutated genes show that PDXliver represents the diversity of human patients. Another feature of PDXliver is storing drug response data of PDX mice, which makes it possible to explore the association between molecular profiles and drug sensitivity. All data can be accessed via the Browse and Search pages. Additionally, two tools are provided to interactively visualize the omics data of selected PDXs or to compare two groups�of PDXs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>As far as we known, PDXliver is the first public database of liver cancer PDX models. We hope that this comprehensive resource will accelerate the utility of PDX models and facilitate liver cancer research. The PDXliver database is freely available online at: http://www.picb.ac.cn/PDXliver/.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,liver cancer - too clinical?
29890119,FlyXCDB-A Resource for Drosophila Cell Surface and Secreted Proteins and Their Extracellular Domains.,"Genomes of metazoan organisms possess a large number of genes encoding cell surface and secreted (CSS) proteins that carry out crucial functions in cell adhesion and communication, signal transduction, extracellular matrix establishment, nutrient digestion and uptake, immunity, and developmental processes. We developed the FlyXCDB database (http://prodata.swmed.edu/FlyXCDB) that provides a comprehensive resource to investigate extracellular (XC) domains in CSS proteins of Drosophila melanogaster, the most studied insect model organism in various aspects of animal biology. More than 300 Drosophila XC domains were discovered in Drosophila CSS proteins encoded by over 2500 genes through analyses of computational predictions of signal peptide, transmembrane (TM) segment, and GPI-anchor signal sequence, profile-based sequence similarity searches, gene ontology, and literature. These domains were classified into six classes mainly based on their molecular functions, including protein-protein interactions (class P), signaling molecules (class S), binding of non-protein molecules or groups (class B), enzyme homologs (class E), enzyme regulation and inhibition (class R), and unknown molecular function (class U). Main cellular functions such as cell adhesion, cell signaling, and extracellular matrix composition were described for the most abundant domains in each functional class. We assigned cell membrane topology categories (E, secreted; S, type I/III single-pass TM; T, type II single-pass TM; M, multi-pass TM; and G, GPI-anchored) to the products of genes with XC domains and investigated their regulation by mechanisms such as alternative splicing and stop codon readthrough.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

The development of differentially diagnostic biomarkers for different subtypes largely depends on understanding the biological pathways and regulatory mechanisms associated with leukemia-implicated genes. Unfortunately, the leukemia-implicated genes that have been identified thus far are scattered among thousands of published studies, and no systematic summary of the differences between adult and childhood leukemia exists with regard to the causative genetic mutations and genetic mechanisms of the various subtypes. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review of those susceptibility genes reported in small-scale experiments and built an online gene database containing a total of 1805 leukemia-associated genes, available at http://soft.bioinfo-minzhao.org/lgl/. Our comparison of genes from the four primary subtypes and between adult and childhood cases identified a number of potential genes related to patient survival.

30150996,AromaDb: A Database of Medicinal and Aromatic Plant's Aroma Molecules With Phytochemistry and Therapeutic Potentials.,"In traditional, herbal medicine, and aromatherapy, use of essential oils and their aroma compounds have been known since long, for the management of various human diseases. The essential oil is a mixture of highly complex, naturally occurring volatile aroma compounds synthesized by medicinal and aromatic plants as secondary metabolites. Essential oils widely used in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, sanitary, food industry and agriculture for their antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, insecticidal, anticancer, neuroprotective, psychophysiological, and anti-aging activities. Moreover, volatile aroma compounds comprise a chemically diverse class of low molecular weight organic compounds with significant vapor pressure. However, aroma compounds produced by plants, mainly attract pollinators, seed dispersers and provide defense against pests or pathogens. However, in humans, about 300 active olfactory receptor genes are involved to detect thousands of different aroma compounds and modulates expression of different metabolic genes regulating human psychophysiological activity, brain function, pharmacological signaling, and therapeutic potential. Keeping in mind this importance, present database, namely, AromaDb (http://bioinfo.cimap.res.in/aromadb/) covers information of plant varieties/chemotypes, essential oils, chemical constituents, GC-MS profile, yield variations due to agro-morphological parameters, trade data, aroma compounds, fragrance type, and bioactivity details. The database includes 1,321 aroma chemical structures, bioactivities of essential oil/aroma compounds, 357 fragrance type, 166 commercially used plants, and their high yielding 148 varieties/chemotypes. Also includes calculated cheminformatics properties related to identification, physico-chemical properties, pharmacokinetics, toxicological, and ecological information. Also comprises interacted human genes affecting various diseases related cell signaling pathways correlating the use of aromatherapy. This database could be a useful resource to the plant's growers/producers, an aroma/fragrance industrialist, health professionals, and researchers exploring the potential of essential oils and aroma compounds in the development of novel formulations against human diseases.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Such known 'unknown' genes constituting the Open Reading Frames (ORF) that remain in the epigenome are termed as orphan genes and the proteins encoded by them but having no experimental evidence of translation are termed as 'Hypothetical Proteins' (HPs).<h4>Objectives</h4>We have enhanced our former database of Hypothetical Proteins (HP) in human (HypoDB) with added annotation, application programming interfaces and descriptive features. The database hosts 1000+ manually curated records of the known 'unknown' regions in the human genome. The new updated version of HypoDB with functionalities (Blast, Match) is freely accessible at http://www.bioclues.org/hypo2.<h4>Methods</h4>The total collection of HPs were checked using experimentally validated sets (from Swiss-Prot) or non-experimentally validated set (TrEMBL) or the complete set (UniProtKB). The database was designed with java at the core backend, integrated with databases, viz. EMBL, PIR, HPRD and those including descriptors for structural databases, interaction and association databases.<h4>Results</h4>The HypoDB constituted Application Programming Interfaces (API) for implicitly searching resources linking them to other databases like NCBI Link-out in addition to multiple search capabilities along with advanced searches using integrated bio-tools, viz. Match and BLAST were incorporated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The HypoDB is perhaps the only open-source HP database with a range of tools for common bioinformatics retrievals and serves as a standby reference to researchers who are interested in finding candidate sequences for their potential experimental work.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

30244175,PTMD: A Database of Human Disease-associated Post-translational Modifications.,"Various posttranslational modifications (PTMs) participate in nearly all aspects of biological processes by regulating protein functions, and aberrant states of PTMs are frequently implicated in human diseases. Therefore, an integral resource of PTM-disease associations (PDAs) would be a great help for both academic research and clinical use. In this work, we reported PTMD, a well-curated database containing PTMs that are associated with human diseases. We manually collected 1950 known PDAs in 749 proteins for 23 types of PTMs and 275 types of diseases from the literature. Database analyses show that phosphorylation has the largest number of disease associations, whereas neurologic diseases have the largest number of PTM associations. We classified all known PDAs into six classes according to the PTM status in diseases and demonstrated that the upregulation and presence of PTM events account for a predominant proportion of disease-associated PTM events. By reconstructing a disease-gene network, we observed that breast cancers have the largest number of associated PTMs and AKT1 has the largest number of PTMs connected to diseases. Finally, the PTMD database was developed with detailed annotations and can be a useful resource for further analyzing the relations between PTMs and human diseases.

More than a hundred of ADs have been described in the literature so far. Although their etiology remains largely unclear, various types of ADs tend to share more associated genes with other types of ADs than with non-AD types. Here we present GAAD, a gene and AD association database. In GAAD, we collected 44,762 associations between 49 ADs and 4249 genes from public databases and MEDLINE documents. We manually verified the associations to ensure the quality and credibility. We reconstructed and recapitulated the relationships among ADs using their shared genes, which further validated the quality of our data. We also provided a list of significantly co-occurring gene pairs among ADs; with embedded tools, users can query gene co-occurrences and construct customized co-occurrence network with genes of interest. To make GAAD more straightforward to experimental biologists and medical scientists, we extracted additional information describing the associations through text mining, including the putative diagnostic value of the associations, type and position of gene polymorphisms, expression changes of implicated genes, as well as the phenotypical consequences, and grouped the associations accordingly.

30652085,PDB_Amyloid: an extended live amyloid structure list from the PDB.,"The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains more than 135�000 entries at present. From these, relatively few amyloid structures can be identified, since amyloids are insoluble in water. Therefore, most amyloid structures deposited in the PDB are in the form of solid state NMR data. Based on the geometric analysis of these deposited structures, we have prepared an automatically updated web server, which generates a list of the deposited amyloid structures, and also entries of globular proteins that have amyloid-like substructures of given size and characteristics. We have found that by applying only appropriately selected geometric conditions, it is possible to identify deposited amyloid structures and a number of globular proteins with amyloid-like substructures. We have analyzed these globular proteins and have found proof in the literature that many of them form amyloids more easily than many other globular proteins. Our results relate to the method of Stankovic <i>et�al</i>. [Stankovic I <i>et�al</i>. (2017) IPSI BgD Tran Int Res 13, 47-51], who applied a hybrid textual-search and geometric approach for finding amyloids in the PDB.

A total of 3,950 primer pairs were identified and developed from EST sequences. The tri and tetra nucleotide repeat motifs were most prevalent (each 24.75%) followed by di-nucleotide repeat motifs. Whole genome-wide analysis found a total of 245,654 SSR repeats across the 16 chromosomes of oil palm, of which 38,717 were compound microsatellite repeats. A web application, OpSatdb, the first microsatellite database of oil palm, was developed using the PHP and MySQL database ( https://ssr.icar.gov.in/index.php ). It is a simple and systematic web-based search engine for searching SSRs based on repeat motif type, repeat type, and primer details. High synteny was observed between oil palm and rice genomes. The mapping of ESTs having SSRs by Blast2GO resulted in the identification of 19.2% sequences with gene ontology (GO) annotations. Randomly, a set of ten genic SSRs and five genomic SSRs were used for validation and genetic diversity on 100 genotypes belonging to the world oil palm genetic resources. The grouping pattern was observed to be broadly in accordance with the geographical origin of the genotypes. The identified genic and genome-wide SSRs can be effectively useful for various genomic applications of oil palm, such as genetic diversity, linkage map construction, mapping of QTLs, marker-assisted selection, and comparative population studies.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

However, the increasing number of bioactive peptide databases is causing the problem of data redundancy and duplicated efforts. Even worse is the fact that the available data is non-standardized and often dirty with data entry errors. Therefore, there is a need for a unified view that enables a more comprehensive analysis of the information on this topic residing at different sites.<h4>Results</h4>After collecting web pages from a large variety of bioactive peptide databases, we organized the web content into an integrated graph database (starPepDB) that holds a total of 71�310 nodes and 348�505 relationships. In this graph structure, there are 45�120 nodes representing peptides, and the rest of the nodes are connected to peptides for describing metadata.

Somatic perturbations of mtDNA are accumulating with age thus it is of great importance to uncover the main sources of mtDNA instability. Recent analyses demonstrated that somatic mtDNA deletions depend on imperfect repeats of various nature between distant mtDNA segments. However, till now there are no comprehensive databases annotating all types of imperfect repeats in numerous species with sequenced complete mitochondrial genome as well as there are no algorithms capable to call all types of imperfect repeats in circular mtDNA.<h4>Results</h4>We implemented na�ve algorithm of pattern recognition by analogy to standard dot-plot construction procedures allowing us to find both perfect and imperfect repeats of four main types: direct, inverted, mirror and complementary. Our algorithm is adapted to specific characteristics of mtDNA such as circularity and an excess of short repeats - it calls imperfect repeats starting from the length of 10 b.p. We constructed interactive web available database ImtRDB depositing perfect and imperfect repeats positions in mtDNAs of more than 3500 Vertebrate species. Additional tools, such as visualization of repeats within a genome, comparison of repeat densities among different genomes and a possibility to download all results make this database useful for many biologists. Our first analyses of the database demonstrated that mtDNA imperfect repeats (i) are usually short; (ii) associated with unfolded DNA structures; (iii) four types of repeats positively correlate with each other forming two equivalent pairs: direct and mirror versus inverted and complementary, with identical nucleotide content and similar distribution between species; (iv) abundance of repeats is negatively associated with GC content; (v) dinucleotides GC versus CG are overrepresented on light chain of mtDNA covered by repeats.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ImtRDB is available at http://bioinfodbs.kantiana.ru/ImtRDB/ . It is accompanied by the software calling all types of interspersed repeats with different level of degeneracy in circular DNA.

A nucleosome consists of 145-147 base pairs of DNA wrapped 1.7 times around eight histones. Given a four-letter code (A, C, G, T), there are approximately 4147 or 1088 oligonucleotides that can form a nucleosome. Comparative, rather than comprehensive, studies are required. Here we introduce the TMB Library of nucleosome simulations and present a meta-analysis of over 20 �s of all atom molecular dynamics simulations representing 518 different realizations of the nucleosome. The TMB Library serves as a reference for future comparative, on-demand simulations of nucleosomes and a demonstration of iBIOMES Lite as a tool for managing a laboratory's simulation library. For every simulation, dewatered trajectories, RMSD, and DNA helical parameter data are provided through iBIOMES Lite in a Web browser and a file browser format. A novel view of nucleosomal DNA emerges from our meta-analysis of the TMB Library. DNA conformation is restricted to a specific left-handed superhelix, but the range of conformations observed for individual bases and base pairs is not more restricted nor more highly deformed than DNA free in solution. With the exception of Roll, mean DNA helical parameter values obtained from simulations of nucleosomes are largely within the range of thermal motion of DNA free in solution. The library provides evidence of DNA kinking in the nucleosome and clearly demonstrates the effects of DNA sequence on the gross structure and dynamics of nucleosomes. These effects and mispositioning of the 601 super strong nucleosome positioning sequence can be detected in short simulations (10 ns). Collectively, the results provide a basis for comparative simulation studies of nucleosomes and extend our understanding of the binding of proteins and drugs to nucleosomal DNA.

By manually curating over ten thousand published articles, 3078 records of modifier information were entered into the current version of PhenoModifier, related to 288 different disorders, 2126 genetic modifier variants and 843 distinct modifier genes. To help users probe further into the mechanism of their interested modifier genes, we extended the yeast genetic interaction data and yeast quantitative trait loci to the human and we also integrated GWAS data into the PhenoModifier to assist users in evaluating all possible phenotypes associated with a modifier allele. As the first comprehensive resource of human genetic modifiers, PhenoModifier provides a more complete spectrum of genetic factors contributing to human phenotypic variation. The portal has a broad scientific and clinical scope, spanning activities relevant to variant interpretation for research purposes as well as clinical decision making.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
31647100,Bovine Genome Database: new annotation tools for a new reference genome.,"The Bovine Genome Database (BGD) (http://bovinegenome.org) has been the key community bovine genomics database for more than a decade. To accommodate the increasing amount and complexity of bovine genomics data, BGD continues to advance its practices in data acquisition, curation, integration and efficient data retrieval. BGD provides tools for genome browsing (JBrowse), genome annotation (Apollo), data mining (BovineMine) and sequence database searching (BLAST). To augment the BGD genome annotation capabilities, we have developed a new Apollo plug-in, called the Locus-Specific Alternate Assembly (LSAA) tool, which enables users to identify and report potential genome assembly errors and structural variants. BGD now hosts both the newest bovine reference genome assembly, ARS-UCD1.2, as well as the previous reference genome, UMD3.1.1, with cross-genome navigation and queries supported in JBrowse and BovineMine, respectively. Other notable enhancements to BovineMine include the incorporation of genomes and gene annotation datasets for non-bovine ruminant species (goat and sheep), support for multiple assemblies per organism in the Regions Search tool, integration of additional ontologies and development of many new template queries. To better serve the research community, we continue to focus on improving existing tools, developing new tools, adding new datasets and encouraging researchers to use these resources.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

This work presents dendPoint, the first in silico model to predict the intravenous pharmacokinetics of dendrimers, a commonly explored drug vector, based on physicochemical properties. We have manually curated the largest relational database of dendrimer pharmacokinetic parameters and their structural/physicochemical properties. This was used to develop a machine learning-based model capable of accurately predicting pharmacokinetic parameters, including half-life, clearance, volume of distribution and dose recovered in the liver and urine. dendPoint successfully predicts dendrimer pharmacokinetic properties, achieving correlations of up to r = 0.83 and Q<sup>2</sup> up to 0.68. dendPoint is freely available as a user-friendly web-service and database at http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/dendpoint .

To meet the modern standards of metabolomics within lichenochemistry, we announce the publication of an open access MS/MS library with 250 metabolites, coined LDB for Lichen DataBase, providing a comprehensive coverage of lichen chemodiversity. These were donated by the Berlin Garden and Botanical Museum from the collection of Siegfried Huneck to be analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Spectra at individual collision energies were submitted to MetaboLights (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS999) while merged spectra were uploaded to the GNPS platform (CCMSLIB00004751209 to CCMSLIB00004751517). Technical validation was achieved by dereplicating three lichen extracts using a Molecular Networking approach, revealing the detection of eleven unique molecules that would have been missed without LDB implementation to the GNPS. From a chemist's viewpoint, this database should help streamlining the isolation of formerly unreported metabolites. From a taxonomist perspective, the LDB offers a versatile tool for the chemical profiling of newly reported species.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

32159215,TeaMiD: a comprehensive database of simple sequence repeat markers of tea.,"Tea is a highly cross-pollinated, woody, perennial tree. High heterozygosity combined with a long gestational period makes conventional breeding a cumbersome process. Therefore, marker-assisted breeding is a better alternative approach when compared with conventional breeding. Considering the large genome size of tea (~3�Gb), information about simple sequence repeat (SSR) is scanty. Thus, we have taken advantage of the recently published tea genomes to identify large numbers of SSR markers in the tea. Besides the genomic sequences, we identified SSRs from the other publicly available sequences such as RNA-seq, GSS, ESTs and organelle genomes (chloroplasts and mitochondrial) and also searched published literature to catalog validated set of tea SSR markers. The complete exercise yielded a total of 935 547 SSRs. Out of the total, 82 SSRs were selected for validation among a diverse set of tea genotypes. Six primers (each with four to six alleles, an average of five alleles per locus) out of the total 27 polymorphic primers were used for a diversity analysis in 36 tea genotypes with mean polymorphic information content of 0.61-0.76. Finally, using all the information generated in this study, we have developed a user-friendly database (TeaMiD; http://indianteagenome.in:8080/teamid/) that hosts SSR from all the six resources including three nuclear genomes of tea and transcriptome sequences of 17 Camellia wild species.

A wealth of information about drug and small molecule structure, targets, indications and side effects; induced gene expression signatures; and other attributes are publicly available through web-based tools, databases and repositories. By processing, abstracting and aggregating information from these resources into drug set libraries, knowledge about novel properties of drugs and small molecules can be systematically imputed with machine learning. In addition, drug set libraries can be used as the underlying database for drug set enrichment analysis. Here, we present Drugmonizome, a database with a search engine for querying annotated sets of drugs and small molecules for performing drug set enrichment analysis. Utilizing the data within Drugmonizome, we also developed Drugmonizome-ML. Drugmonizome-ML enables users to construct customized machine learning pipelines using the drug set libraries from Drugmonizome. To demonstrate the utility of Drugmonizome, drug sets from 12 independent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro screens were subjected to consensus enrichment analysis. Despite the low overlap among these 12 independent in vitro screens, we identified common biological processes critical for blocking viral replication. To demonstrate Drugmonizome-ML, we constructed a machine learning pipeline to predict whether approved and preclinical drugs may induce peripheral neuropathy as a potential side effect. Overall, the Drugmonizome and Drugmonizome-ML resources provide rich and diverse knowledge about drugs and small molecules for direct systems pharmacology applications.

These so-called N-fixing plants are widely used for reclamation of disturbed vegetation and improvement of soil fertility in agroforestry. Yet, available information about plants that are capable of establishing nodulation is fragmented and somewhat outdated. This article introduces the NodDB database of N-fixing plants based on morphological and phylogenetic evidence (available at https://doi.org/10.15156/bio/587469) and discusses plant groups with conflicting reports and interpretation, such as certain legume clades and the Zygophyllaceae family. During angiosperm evolution, N-fixing plants became common in the fabid rather than in the �nitrogen-fixing� clade. The global GBIF plant species distribution data indicated that N-fixing plants tend to be relatively more diverse in savanna and semi-desert biomes.

21464845,An ANN model for the identification of deleterious nsSNPs in tumor suppressor genes.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Human genetic variations primarily result from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occurs approximately every 1000 bases in the overall human population. The non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), lead to amino acid changes in the protein product may account for nearly half of the known genetic variations linked to inherited human diseases and cancer. One of the main problems of medical genetics today is to identify nsSNPs that underlie disease-related phenotypes in humans. An attempt was made to develop a new approach to predict such nsSNPs. This would enhance our understanding of genetic diseases and helps to predict the disease. We detect nsSNPs and all possible and reliable alleles by ANN, a soft computing model using potential SNP information. Reliable nsSNPs are identified, based on the reconstructed alleles and on sequence redundancy. The model gives good results with mean specificity (95.85&), sensitivity (97.40&) and accuracy (96.25&). Our results indicate that ANNs can serve as a useful method to analyze quantitative effect of nsSNPs on protein function and would be useful for large-scale analysis of genomic nsSNP data.<h4>Availability</h4>The database is available for free at http://www.snp.mirworks.in.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,"no notes; reassessed and re-scored - says database available but abstract is entirely about the ANN method, iffy"
21523935,ncRNA consensus secondary structure derivation using grammar strings.,"Many noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) function through both their sequences and secondary structures. Thus, secondary structure derivation is an important issue in today's RNA research. The state-of-the-art structure annotation tools are based on comparative analysis, which derives consensus structure of homologous ncRNAs. Despite promising results from existing ncRNA aligning and consensus structure derivation tools, there is a need for more efficient and accurate ncRNA secondary structure modeling and alignment methods. In this work, we introduce a consensus structure derivation approach based on grammar string, a novel ncRNA secondary structure representation that encodes an ncRNA's sequence and secondary structure in the parameter space of a context-free grammar (CFG) and a full RNA grammar including pseudoknots. Being a string defined on a special alphabet constructed from a grammar, grammar string converts ncRNA alignment into sequence alignment. We derive consensus secondary structures from hundreds of ncRNA families from BraliBase 2.1 and 25 families containing pseudoknots using grammar string alignment. Our experiments have shown that grammar string-based structure derivation competes favorably in consensus structure quality with Murlet and RNASampler.

Punch is based on sequence and structural templates trained with support vector machines. ESpritz is an efficient single sequence method based on bidirectional recursive neural networks. Spritz was extended to filter predictions based on structural homologues. After extensive testing, predictions are combined by averaging their probabilities. The CSpritz website can elaborate single or multiple predictions for either short or long disorder. The server provides a global output page, for download and simultaneous statistics of all predictions. Links are provided to each individual protein where the amino acid sequence and disorder prediction are displayed along with statistics for the individual protein. As a novel feature, CSpritz provides information about structural homologues as well as secondary structure and short functional linear motifs in each disordered segment. Benchmarking was performed on the very recent CASP9 data, where CSpritz would have ranked consistently well with a Sw measure of 49.27 and AUC of 0.828.

R. solanacearum, together with Arabidopsis thaliana, has become a model system for studying the molecular basis of plant-pathogen interactions. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a critical role in the infection process, and some PPIs can initiate a plant defense response. However, experimental investigations have rarely addressed such PPIs. Using two computational methods, the interolog and the domain-based methods, we predicted 3,074 potential PPIs between 119 R. solanacearum and 1,442 A. thaliana proteins. Interestingly, we found that the potential pathogen-targeted proteins are more important in the A. thaliana PPI network. To facilitate further studies, all predicted PPI data were compiled into a database server called PPIRA (http://protein.cau.edu.cn/ppira/).

This complex process, which can involve translocation and/or modification of transcriptional regulators, is not completely understood. Here, we applied a method for large-scale profiling of nuclear proteins to quantify vasopressin-induced changes in the nuclear proteome of cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD) cells. Using stable isotope labeling and tandem mass spectrometry, we quantified 3987 nuclear proteins and identified significant changes in the abundance of 65, including previously established targets of vasopressin signaling in the collecting duct. Vasopressin-induced changes in the abundance of the transcription factors JunB, Elf3, Gatad2b, and Hmbox1; transcriptional co-regulators Ctnnb1 (�-catenin) and Crebbp; subunits of the Mediator complex; E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4; nuclear transport regulator RanGap1; and several proteins associated with tight junctions and adherens junctions. Bioinformatic analysis showed that many of the quantified transcription factors have putative binding sites in the 5'-flanking regions of genes coding for the channel proteins Aqp2, Aqp3, Scnn1b (ENaC�), and Scnn1g (ENaC<U+03B3>), which are known targets of vasopressin. Immunoblotting demonstrated that the increase in �-catenin in nuclear fractions was accompanied by an even larger increase in its phosphorylated form (pSer552).

22669907,Cscan: finding common regulators of a set of genes by using a collection of genome-wide ChIP-seq datasets.,"The regulation of transcription of eukaryotic genes is a very complex process, which involves interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and DNA, as well as other epigenetic factors like histone modifications, DNA methylation, and so on, which nowadays can be studied and characterized with techniques like ChIP-Seq. Cscan is a web resource that includes a large collection of genome-wide ChIP-Seq experiments performed on TFs, histone modifications, RNA polymerases and others. Enriched peak regions from the ChIP-Seq experiments are crossed with the genomic coordinates of a set of input genes, to identify which of the experiments present a statistically significant number of peaks within the input genes' loci. The input can be a cluster of co-expressed genes, or any other set of genes sharing a common regulatory profile. Users can thus single out which TFs are likely to be common regulators of the genes, and their respective correlations. Also, by examining results on promoter activation, transcription, histone modifications, polymerase binding and so on, users can investigate the effect of the TFs (activation or repression of transcription) as well as of the cell or tissue specificity of the genes' regulation and expression. The web interface is free for use, and there is no login requirement.

22759420,Comparative evaluation of set-level techniques in predictive classification of gene expression samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>Analysis of gene expression data in terms of a priori-defined gene sets has recently received significant attention as this approach typically yields more compact and interpretable results than those produced by traditional methods that rely on individual genes. The set-level strategy can also be adopted with similar benefits in predictive classification tasks accomplished with machine learning algorithms. Initial studies into the predictive performance of set-level classifiers have yielded rather controversial results. The goal of this study is to provide a more conclusive evaluation by testing various components of the set-level framework within a large collection of machine learning experiments.<h4>Results</h4>Genuine curated gene sets constitute better features for classification than sets assembled without biological relevance. For identifying the best gene sets for classification, the Global test outperforms the gene-set methods GSEA and SAM-GS as well as two generic feature selection methods. To aggregate expressions of genes into a feature value, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method as well as the SetSig technique improve on simple arithmetic averaging. Set-level classifiers learned with 10 features constituted by the Global test slightly outperform baseline gene-level classifiers learned with all original data features although they are slightly less accurate than gene-level classifiers learned with a prior feature-selection step.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Set-level classifiers do not boost predictive accuracy, however, they do achieve competitive accuracy if learned with the right combination of ingredients.<h4>Availability</h4>Open-source, publicly available software was used for classifier learning and testing. The gene expression datasets and the gene set database used are also publicly available.

Such data is necessary, as predicted sites may serve as excellent starting locations for future omics studies to develop transcriptional regulation hypotheses. In order to generate this resource, we employed a phylogenetic footprinting approach-using sequence conservation across cattle, human and dog-and position-specific scoring matrices to identify 379,333 putative TFBSs upstream of nearly 8000 Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) annotated genes within the cattle genome. Comparisons of our predictions to known binding site loci within the PCK1, ACTA1 and G6PC promoter regions revealed 75% sensitivity for our method of discovery. Additionally, we intersected our predictions with known cattle SNP variants in dbSNP and on the Illumina BovineHD 770k and Bos 1 SNP chips, finding 7534, 444 and 346 overlaps, respectively. Due to our stringent filtering criteria, these results represent high quality predictions of putative TFBSs within the cattle genome.

23704925,Comprehensive genomic characterization of cutaneous malignant melanoma cell lines derived from metastatic lesions by whole-exome sequencing and SNP array profiling.,"Cutaneous malignant melanoma is the most fatal skin cancer and although improved comprehension of its pathogenic pathways allowed to realize some effective molecular targeted therapies, novel targets and drugs are still needed. Aiming to add genetic information potentially useful for novel targets discovery, we performed an extensive genomic characterization by whole-exome sequencing and SNP array profiling of six cutaneous melanoma cell lines derived from metastatic patients. We obtained a total of 3,325 novel coding single nucleotide variants, including 2,172 non-synonymous variants. We catalogued the coding mutations according to Sanger COSMIC database and to a manually curated list including genes involved in melanoma pathways identified by mining recent literature. Besides confirming the presence of known melanoma driver mutations (BRAF(V600E), NRAS(Q61R) ), we identified novel mutated genes involved in signalling pathways crucial for melanoma pathogenesis and already addressed by current targeted therapies (such as MAPK and glutamate pathways). We also identified mutations in four genes (MUC19, PAICS, RBMXL1, KIF23) never reported in melanoma, which might deserve further investigations. All data are available to the entire research community in our Melanoma Exome Database (at https://155.253.6.64/MExDB/). In summary, these cell lines are valuable biological tools to improve the genetic comprehension of this complex cancer disease and to study functional relevance of individual mutational events, and these findings could provide insights potentially useful for identification of novel therapeutic targets for cutaneous malignant melanoma.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource

However, most of the information remains locked up in discrete documents that are not always interconnected or machine-readable. The connectivity tissue provided by RDF technology has not yet been widely used to support the generation of self-describing, machine-readable documents.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we present our approach to the generation of self-describing machine-readable scholarly documents. We understand the scientific document as an entry point and interface to the Web of Data. We have semantically processed the full-text, open-access subset of PubMed Central. Our RDF model and resulting dataset make extensive use of existing ontologies and semantic enrichment services. We expose our model, services, prototype, and datasets at http://biotea.idiginfo.org/<h4>Conclusions</h4>The semantic processing of biomedical literature presented in this paper embeds documents within the Web of Data and facilitates the execution of concept-based queries against the entire digital library. Our approach delivers a flexible and adaptable set of tools for metadata enrichment and semantic processing of biomedical documents. Our model delivers a semantically rich and highly interconnected dataset with self-describing content so that software can make effective use of it.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - software and includes a data resource
23828786,Towards building a disease-phenotype knowledge base: extracting disease-manifestation relationship from literature.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Systems approaches to studying phenotypic relationships among diseases are emerging as an active area of research for both novel disease gene discovery and drug repurposing. Currently, systematic study of disease phenotypic relationships on a phenome-wide scale is limited because large-scale machine-understandable disease-phenotype relationship knowledge bases are often unavailable. Here, we present an automatic approach to extract disease-manifestation (D-M) pairs (one specific type of disease-phenotype relationship) from the wide body of published biomedical literature.<h4>Data and methods</h4>Our method leverages external knowledge and limits the amount of human effort required. For the text corpus, we used 119 085 682 MEDLINE sentences (21 354 075 citations). First, we used D-M pairs from existing biomedical ontologies as prior knowledge to automatically discover D-M-specific syntactic patterns. We then extracted additional pairs from MEDLINE using the learned patterns. Finally, we analysed correlations between disease manifestations and disease-associated genes and drugs to demonstrate the potential of this newly created knowledge base in disease gene discovery and drug repurposing.<h4>Results</h4>In total, we extracted 121 359 unique D-M pairs with a high precision of 0.924. Among the extracted pairs, 120 419 (99.2%) have not been captured in existing structured knowledge sources. We have shown that disease manifestations correlate positively with both disease-associated genes and drug treatments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The main contribution of our study is the creation of a large-scale and accurate D-M phenotype relationship knowledge base. This unique knowledge base, when combined with existing phenotypic, genetic and proteomic datasets, can have profound implications in our deeper understanding of disease etiology and in rapid drug repurposing.<h4>Availability</h4>http://nlp.case.edu/public/data/DMPatternUMLS/","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource
23868073,Large-scale gene function analysis with the PANTHER classification system.,"The PANTHER (protein annotation through evolutionary relationship) classification system (http://www.pantherdb.org/) is a comprehensive system that combines gene function, ontology, pathways and statistical analysis tools that enable biologists to analyze large-scale, genome-wide data from sequencing, proteomics or gene expression experiments. The system is built with 82 complete genomes organized into gene families and subfamilies, and their evolutionary relationships are captured in phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments and statistical models (hidden Markov models or HMMs). Genes are classified according to their function in several different ways: families and subfamilies are annotated with ontology terms (Gene Ontology (GO) and PANTHER protein class), and sequences are assigned to PANTHER pathways. The PANTHER website includes a suite of tools that enable users to browse and query gene functions, and to analyze large-scale experimental data with a number of statistical tests. It is widely used by bench scientists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and systems biologists. In the 2013 release of PANTHER (v.8.0), in addition to an update of the data content, we redesigned the website interface to improve both user experience and the system's analytical capability.

23989082,PhenDisco: phenotype discovery system for the database of genotypes and phenotypes.,"The database of genotypes and phenotypes (dbGaP) developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is a resource that contains information on various genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and is currently available via NCBI's dbGaP Entrez interface. The database is an important resource, providing GWAS data that can be used for new exploratory research or cross-study validation by authorized users. However, finding studies relevant to a particular phenotype of interest is challenging, as phenotype information is presented in a non-standardized way. To address this issue, we developed PhenDisco (phenotype discoverer), a new information retrieval system for dbGaP. PhenDisco consists of two main components: (1) text processing tools that standardize phenotype variables and study metadata, and (2) information retrieval tools that support queries from users and return ranked results. In a preliminary comparison involving 18 search scenarios, PhenDisco showed promising performance for both unranked and ranked search comparisons with dbGaP's search engine Entrez.

24060102,Comparative genomics of metabolic capacities of regulons controlled by cis-regulatory RNA motifs in bacteria.,"<h4>Background</h4>In silico comparative genomics approaches have been efficiently used for functional prediction and reconstruction of metabolic and regulatory networks. Riboswitches are metabolite-sensing structures often found in bacterial mRNA leaders controlling gene expression on transcriptional or translational levels.An increasing number of riboswitches and other cis-regulatory RNAs have been recently classified into numerous RNA families in the Rfam database. High conservation of these RNA motifs provides a unique advantage for their genomic identification and comparative analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A comparative genomics approach implemented in the RegPredict tool was used for reconstruction and functional annotation of regulons controlled by RNAs from 43 Rfam families in diverse taxonomic groups of Bacteria. The inferred regulons include ~5200 cis-regulatory RNAs and more than 12000 target genes in 255 microbial genomes. All predicted RNA-regulated genes were classified into specific and overall functional categories. Analysis of taxonomic distribution of these categories allowed us to establish major functional preferences for each analyzed cis-regulatory RNA motif family. Overall, most RNA motif regulons showed predictable functional content in accordance with their experimentally established effector ligands. Our results suggest that some RNA motifs (including thiamin pyrophosphate and cobalamin riboswitches that control the cofactor metabolism) are widespread and likely originated from the last common ancestor of all bacteria. However, many more analyzed RNA motifs are restricted to a narrow taxonomic group of bacteria and likely represent more recent evolutionary innovations.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The reconstructed regulatory networks for major known RNA motifs substantially expand the existing knowledge of transcriptional regulation in bacteria. The inferred regulons can be used for genetic experiments, functional annotations of genes, metabolic reconstruction and evolutionary analysis. The obtained genome-wide collection of reference RNA motif regulons is available in the RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov/).","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource
24087878,OpenMSI: a high-performance web-based platform for mass spectrometry imaging.,"Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables researchers to directly probe endogenous molecules directly within the architecture of the biological matrix. Unfortunately, efficient access, management, and analysis of the data generated by MSI approaches remain major challenges to this rapidly developing field. Despite the availability of numerous dedicated file formats and software packages, it is a widely held viewpoint that the biggest challenge is simply opening, sharing, and analyzing a file without loss of information. Here we present OpenMSI, a software framework and platform that addresses these challenges via an advanced, high-performance, extensible file format and Web API for remote data access (http://openmsi.nersc.gov). The OpenMSI file format supports storage of raw MSI data, metadata, and derived analyses in a single, self-describing format based on HDF5 and is supported by a large range of analysis software (e.g., Matlab and R) and programming languages (e.g., C++, Fortran, and Python). Careful optimization of the storage layout of MSI data sets using chunking, compression, and data replication accelerates common, selective data access operations while minimizing data storage requirements and are critical enablers of rapid data I/O. The OpenMSI file format has shown to provide >2000-fold improvement for image access operations, enabling spectrum and image retrieval in less than 0.3 s across the Internet even for 50 GB MSI data sets. To make remote high-performance compute resources accessible for analysis and to facilitate data sharing and collaboration, we describe an easy-to-use yet powerful Web API, enabling fast and convenient access to MSI data, metadata, and derived analysis results stored remotely to facilitate high-performance data analysis and enable implementation of Web based data sharing, visualization, and analysis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,no notes; reassessed and re-scored - software

Since its previous publication in 2012, the number of entries in IDEAL has almost tripled (120 to 340). In addition to the increase in quantity, the quality of IDEAL has been significantly improved. The new IDEAL incorporates the interactions of IDPs and their binding partners more explicitly, and illustrates the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and the structures of protein complexes. Redundant experimental data are arranged based on the clustering of Protein Data Bank entries, and similar sequences with the same binding mode are grouped. As a result, the new IDEAL presents more concise and informative experimental data. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) disorder is annotated in a systematic manner, by identifying the regions with large deviations among the NMR models. The ordered/disordered and new domain predictions by DICHOT are available, as well as the domain assignments by HMMER. Some examples of the PPI networks and the highly deviated regions derived from NMR models will be described, together with other advances. These enhancements will facilitate deeper understanding of IDPs, in terms of their flexibility, plasticity and promiscuity.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource
24319143,MMDB and VAST+: tracking structural similarities between macromolecular complexes.,"The computational detection of similarities between protein 3D structures has become an indispensable tool for the detection of homologous relationships, the classification of protein families and functional inference. Consequently, numerous algorithms have been developed that facilitate structure comparison, including rapid searches against a steadily growing collection of protein structures. To this end, NCBI's Molecular Modeling Database (MMDB), which is based on the Protein Data Bank (PDB), maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date archive of protein structure similarities computed with the Vector Alignment Search Tool (VAST). These similarities have been recorded on the level of single proteins and protein domains, comprising in excess of 1.5 billion pairwise alignments. Here we present VAST+, an extension to the existing VAST service, which summarizes and presents structural similarity on the level of biological assemblies or macromolecular complexes. VAST+ simplifies structure neighboring results and shows, for macromolecular complexes tracked in MMDB, lists of similar complexes ranked by the extent of similarity. VAST+ replaces the previous VAST service as the default presentation of structure neighboring data in NCBI's Entrez query and retrieval system.

24372041,miRror2.0: a platform for assessing the joint action of microRNAs in cell regulation.,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate the levels of mRNA post-transcriptionally. Recent experiments revealed thousands of mRNA-miRNA pairs in which multiple miRNAs may bind the same transcript. These results raised the notion of miRNAs teamwork for a wide range of cellular context. miRror2.0 utilizes the miRNA-target predictions from over a dozen programs and resources and unifies them under a common statistical basis. The platform, called miRror2.0, considers the combinatorial regulation by miRNAs in different tissues, cell lines and under a broad range of conditions. A flexible setting permits the selection of the preferred combination of miRNA-target prediction resources as well as the statistical parameters for the analysis. miRror2.0 covers six major model organisms including human and mouse. Importantly, the system is capable of analyzing hundreds of genes that were subjected to miRNAs' regulation. Activating miRror2.0 by introducing thousands of genes from miRNA overexpression experiments successfully identified the objective miRNAs. The output from miRror2.0 is a list of genes that is optimally regulated by a defined set of miRNAs. A symmetric application of miRror2.0 starts with a set of miRNAs, and the system then seeks the preferred set of genes that are regulated by that miRNA composition. The results from miRror2.0 are empowered by an iterative procedure called PSI-miRror. PSI-miRror tests the robustness of miRror2.0 prediction. It allows a refinement of the initial list of genes in view of the miRNAs that optimally regulate this list. We present miRror2.0 as a valuable resource for supporting cellular experimentalists that seek recovery of combinatorial regulation by miRNAs from noisy experimental data. miRror2.0 is available at http://www.mirrorsuite.cs.huji.ac.il .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,iffy; reassessed and re-scored - software
24464816,PRIMSIPLR: prediction of inner-membrane situated pore-lining residues for alpha-helical transmembrane proteins.,"Transmembrane proteins such as transporters and channels mediate the passage of inorganic and organic substances across biological membranes through their central pore. Pore-lining residues (PLRs) that make direct contacts to the substrates have a crucial impact on the function of the protein and, hence, their identification is a key step in mechanistic studies. Here, we established a nonredundant data set containing the three-dimensional (3D) structures of 90 a-helical transmembrane proteins and annotated the PLRs of these proteins by a pore identification software. A support vector machine was then trained to distinguish PLRs from other residues based on the protein sequence alone. Using sixfold cross-validation, our best performing predictor gave a Matthews's correlation coefficient of 0.41 with an accuracy of 0.86, sensitivity of 0.61, and specificity of 0.89, respectively.

24580755,"CDSbank: taxonomy-aware extraction, selection, renaming and formatting of protein-coding DNA or amino acid sequences.","<h4>Background</h4>Protein-coding DNA sequences and their corresponding amino acid sequences are routinely used to study relationships between sequence, structure, function, and evolution. The rapidly growing size of sequence databases increases the power of such comparative analyses but it makes it more challenging to prepare high quality sequence data sets with control over redundancy, quality, completeness, formatting, and labeling. Software tools for some individual steps in this process exist but manual intervention remains a common and time consuming necessity.<h4>Description</h4>CDSbank is a database that stores both the protein-coding DNA sequence (CDS) and amino acid sequence for each protein annotated in Genbank. CDSbank also stores Genbank feature annotation, a flag to indicate incomplete 5' and 3' ends, full taxonomic data, and a heuristic to rank the scientific interest of each species. This rich information allows fully automated data set preparation with a level of sophistication that aims to meet or exceed manual processing. Defaults ensure ease of use for typical scenarios while allowing great flexibility when needed. Access is via a free web server at http://hazeslab.med.ualberta.ca/CDSbank/.<h4>Conclusions</h4>CDSbank presents a user-friendly web server to download, filter, format, and name large sequence data sets. Common usage scenarios can be accessed via pre-programmed default choices, while optional sections give full control over the processing pipeline. Particular strengths are: extract protein-coding DNA sequences just as easily as amino acid sequences, full access to taxonomy for labeling and filtering, awareness of incomplete sequences, and the ability to take one protein sequence and extract all synonymous CDS or identical protein sequences in other species. Finally, CDSbank can also create labeled property files to, for instance, annotate or re-label phylogenetic trees.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource
24655548,Analysis of growth factor signaling in genetically diverse breast cancer lines.,"<h4>Background</h4>Soluble growth factors present in the microenvironment play a major role in tumor development, invasion, metastasis, and responsiveness to targeted therapies. While the biochemistry of growth factor-dependent signal transduction has been studied extensively in individual cell types, relatively little systematic data are available across genetically diverse cell lines.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a quantitative and comparative dataset focused on immediate-early signaling that regulates the AKT (AKT1/2/3) and ERK (MAPK1/3) pathways in a canonical panel of well-characterized breast cancer lines. We also provide interactive web-based tools to facilitate follow-on analysis of the data. Our findings show that breast cancers are diverse with respect to ligand sensitivity and signaling biochemistry. Surprisingly, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs; which express low levels of ErbB2, progesterone and estrogen receptors) are the most broadly responsive to growth factors and HER2amp cancers (which overexpress ErbB2) the least. The ratio of ERK to AKT activation varies with ligand and subtype, with a systematic bias in favor of ERK in hormone receptor positive (HR+) cells. The factors that correlate with growth factor responsiveness depend on whether fold-change or absolute activity is considered the key biological variable, and they differ between ERK and AKT pathways.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Responses to growth factors are highly diverse across breast cancer cell lines, even within the same subtype. A simple four-part heuristic suggests that diversity arises from variation in receptor abundance, an ERK/AKT bias that depends on ligand identity, a set of factors common to all receptors that varies in abundance or activity with cell line, and an """"indirect negative regulation"""" by ErbB2. This analysis sets the stage for the development of a mechanistic and predictive model of growth factor signaling in diverse cancer lines.

24678734,Research resource: EPSLiM: ensemble predictor for short linear motifs in nuclear hormone receptors.,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of transcription factors central to regulating many biological processes, including cell growth, death, metabolism, and immune responses. NR-mediated gene expression can be modulated by coactivators and corepressors through direct physical interaction or protein complexes with functional domains in NRs. One class of these domains includes short linear motifs (SLiMs), which facilitate protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation, and ligand binding primarily in the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins. Across all proteins, the number of known SLiMs is limited due to the difficulty in studying IDRs experimentally. Computational tools provide a systematic and data-driven approach for predicting functional motifs that can be used to prioritize experimental efforts. Accordingly, several tools have been developed based on sequence conservation or biophysical features; however, discrepancies in predictions make it difficult to determine the true candidate SLiMs. In this work, we present the ensemble predictor for short linear motifs (EPSLiM), a novel strategy to prioritize the residues that are most likely to be SLiMs in IDRs. EPSLiM applies a generalized linear model to integrate predictions from individual methodologies. We show that EPSLiM outperforms individual predictors, and we apply our method to NRs. The androgen receptor is an example with an N-terminal domain of 559 disordered amino acids that contains several validated SLiMs important for transcriptional activation. We use the androgen receptor to illustrate the predictive performance of EPSLiM and make the results of all human and mouse NRs publically available through the web service http://epslim.bwh.harvard.edu.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data set","resulting data is what's available; reassessed and still yes - tricky abstract, it's the data that's available"
24727366,"'In silico expression analysis', a novel PathoPlant web tool to identify abiotic and biotic stress conditions associated with specific cis-regulatory sequences.","Using bioinformatics, putative cis-regulatory sequences can be easily identified using pattern recognition programs on promoters of specific gene sets. The abundance of predicted cis-sequences is a major challenge to associate these sequences with a possible function in gene expression regulation. To identify a possible function of the predicted cis-sequences, a novel web tool designated 'in silico expression analysis' was developed that correlates submitted cis-sequences with gene expression data from Arabidopsis thaliana. The web tool identifies the A. thaliana genes harbouring the sequence in a defined promoter region and compares the expression of these genes with microarray data. The result is a hierarchy of abiotic and biotic stress conditions to which these genes are most likely responsive. When testing the performance of the web tool, known cis-regulatory sequences were submitted to the 'in silico expression analysis' resulting in the correct identification of the associated stress conditions. When using a recently identified novel elicitor-responsive sequence, a WT-box (CGACTTTT), the 'in silico expression analysis' predicts that genes harbouring this sequence in their promoter are most likely Botrytis cinerea induced. Consistent with this prediction, the strongest induction of a reporter gene harbouring this sequence in the promoter is observed with B. cinerea in transgenic A. thaliana.

25119676,Improvements to pairwise sequence comparison (PASC): a genome-based web tool for virus classification.,"The number of viral genome sequences in the public databases is increasing dramatically, and these sequences are playing an important role in virus classification. Pairwise sequence comparison is a sequence-based virus classification method. A program using this method calculates the pairwise identities of virus sequences within a virus family and displays their distribution, and visual analysis helps to determine demarcations at different taxonomic levels such as strain, species, genus and subfamily. Subsequent comparison of new sequences against existing ones allows viruses from which the new sequences were derived to be classified. Although this method cannot be used as the only criterion for virus classification in some cases, it is a quantitative method and has many advantages over conventional virus classification methods. It has been applied to several virus families, and there is an increasing interest in using this method for other virus families/groups. The Pairwise Sequence Comparison (PASC) classification tool was created at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The tool's database stores pairwise identities for complete genomes/segments of 56 virus families/groups. Data in the system are updated every day to reflect changes in virus taxonomy and additions of new virus sequences to the public database. The web interface of the tool ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/pasc/ ) makes it easy to navigate and perform analyses. Multiple new viral genome sequences can be tested simultaneously with this system to suggest the taxonomic position of virus isolates in a specific family. PASC eliminates potential discrepancies in the results caused by different algorithms and/or different data used by researchers.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - data available
25179504,Differential motif enrichment analysis of paired ChIP-seq experiments.,"<h4>Background</h4>Motif enrichment analysis of transcription factor ChIP-seq data can help identify transcription factors that cooperate or compete. Previously, little attention has been given to comparative motif enrichment analysis of pairs of ChIP-seq experiments, where the binding of the same transcription factor is assayed under different conditions. Such comparative analysis could potentially identify the distinct regulatory partners/competitors of the assayed transcription factor under different conditions or at different stages of development.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a new methodology for identifying sequence motifs that are differentially enriched in one set of DNA or RNA sequences relative to another set, and apply it to paired ChIP-seq experiments. We show that, using paired ChIP-seq data for a single transcription factor, differential motif enrichment analysis identifies all the known key transcription factors involved in the transformation of non-cancerous immortalized breast cells (MCF10A-ER-Src cells) into cancer stem cells whereas non-differential motif enrichment analysis does not. We also show that differential motif enrichment analysis identifies regulatory motifs that are significantly enriched at constrained locations within the bound promoters, and that these motifs are not identified by non-differential motif enrichment analysis. Our methodology differs from other approaches in that it leverages both comparative enrichment and positional enrichment of motifs in ChIP-seq peak regions or in the promoters of genes bound by the transcription factor.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We show that differential motif enrichment analysis of paired ChIP-seq experiments offers biological insights not available from non-differential analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, our method detects motifs that are enriched in a constrained region in one set of sequences, but not enriched in the same region in the comparative set. We have enhanced the web-based CentriMo algorithm to allow it to perform the constrained differential motif enrichment analysis described in this paper, and CentriMo's on-line interface (http://meme.ebi.edu.au) provides dozens of databases of DNA- and RNA-binding motifs from a full range of organisms.

25540186,Knowledge-based modeling of peptides at protein interfaces: PiPreD.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underpin virtually all cellular processes both in health and disease. Modulating the interaction between proteins by means of small (chemical) agents is therefore a promising route for future novel therapeutic interventions. In this context, peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of PPIs.<h4>Results</h4>We reported a novel computational, structure and knowledge-based approach to model orthosteric peptides to target PPIs: PiPreD. PiPreD relies on a precompiled and bespoken library of structural motifs, iMotifs, extracted from protein complexes and a fast structural modeling algorithm driven by the location of native chemical groups on the interface of the protein target named anchor residues. PiPreD comprehensive and systematically samples the entire interface deriving peptide conformations best suited for the given region on the protein interface.

25629077,Genetic variability of microRNA regulome in human.,"MicroRNAs are currently being extensively studied due to their important role as post-transcriptional regulators. During miRNA biogenesis, precursors undergo two cleavage steps performed by Drosha-DGCR8 (Microprocessor) cleaving of pri-miRNA to produce pre-miRNA and Dicer-mediated cleaving to create mature miRNA. Genetic variants within human miRNA regulome have been shown to influence miRNA expression, target interaction and to affect the phenotype. In this study, we reviewed the literature, existing bioinformatics tools and catalogs associated with polymorphic miRNA regulome, and organized them into four categories: (1) polymorphisms located within miRNA genes (miR-SNPs), (2) transcription factor-binding sites/miRNA regulatory regions (miR-rSNPs), (3) miRNA target sites (miR-TS-SNPs), and 4. miRNA silencing machinery (miR-SM-SNPs). Since the miR-SM-SNPs have not been systematically studied yet, we have collected polymorphisms associated with miRNA silencing machinery. We have developed two catalogs containing genetic variability within: (1) genes encoding three main catalytic components of the silencing machinery, DROSHA, DGCR8, and DICER1; (2) miRNA genes itself, overlapping Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites. The developed resource of polymorphisms is available online (http://www.integratomics-time.com/miRNA-regulome) and will be useful for further functional studies and development of biomarkers associated with diseases and phenotypic traits.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource
26109357,Gene Model Annotations for Drosophila melanogaster: Impact of High-Throughput Data.,"We report the current status of the FlyBase annotated gene set for Drosophila melanogaster and highlight improvements based on high-throughput data. The FlyBase annotated gene set consists entirely of manually annotated gene models, with the exception of some classes of small non-coding RNAs. All gene models have been reviewed using evidence from high-throughput datasets, primarily from the modENCODE project. These datasets include RNA-Seq coverage data, RNA-Seq junction data, transcription start site profiles, and translation stop-codon read-through predictions. New annotation guidelines were developed to take into account the use of the high-throughput data. We describe how this flood of new data was incorporated into thousands of new and revised annotations. FlyBase has adopted a philosophy of excluding low-confidence and low-frequency data from gene model annotations; we also do not attempt to represent all possible permutations for complex and modularly organized genes. This has allowed us to produce a high-confidence, manageable gene annotation dataset that is available at FlyBase (http://flybase.org). Interesting aspects of new annotations include new genes (coding, non-coding, and antisense), many genes with alternative transcripts with very long 3' UTRs (up to 15-18 kb), and a stunning mismatch in the number of male-specific genes (approximately 13% of all annotated gene models) vs. female-specific genes (less than 1%). The number of identified pseudogenes and mutations in the sequenced strain also increased significantly. We discuss remaining challenges, for instance, identification of functional small polypeptides and detection of alternative translation starts.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource
26148193,Basic Emotions in the Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL BE): New Method of Classifying Emotional Stimuli.,"The Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL) has recently been introduced as a standardized database of Polish words suitable for studying various aspects of language and emotions. Though the NAWL was originally based on the most commonly used dimensional approach, it is not the only way of studying emotions. Another framework is based on discrete emotional categories. Since the two perspectives are recognized as complementary, the aim of the present study was to supplement the NAWL database by the addition of categories corresponding to basic emotions. Thus, 2902 Polish words from the NAWL were presented to 265 subjects, who were instructed to rate them according to the intensity of each of the five basic emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, fear and disgust. The general characteristics of the present word database, as well as the relationships between the studied variables are shown to be consistent with typical patterns found in previous studies using similar databases for different languages. Here we present the Basic Emotions in the Nencki Affective Word List (NAWL BE) as a database of verbal material suitable for highly controlled experimental research. To make the NAWL more convenient to use, we introduce a comprehensive method of classifying stimuli to basic emotion categories. We discuss the advantages of our method in comparison to other methods of classification. Additionally, we provide an interactive online tool (http://exp.lobi.nencki.gov.pl/nawl-analysis) to help researchers browse and interactively generate classes of stimuli to meet their specific requirements.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,no notes; reassessed and re-scored - does ref a db but url is to a tool
26227548,Simulated unbound structures for benchmarking of protein docking in the DOCKGROUND resource.,"<h4>Background</h4>Proteins play an important role in biological processes in living organisms. Many protein functions are based on interaction with other proteins. The structural information is important for adequate description of these interactions. Sets of protein structures determined in both bound and unbound states are essential for benchmarking of the docking procedures. However, the number of such proteins in PDB is relatively small. A radical expansion of such sets is possible if the unbound structures are computationally simulated.<h4>Results</h4>The DOCKGROUND public resource provides data to improve our understanding of protein-protein interactions and to assist in the development of better tools for structural modeling of protein complexes, such as docking algorithms and scoring functions. A large set of simulated unbound protein structures was generated from the bound structures. The modeling protocol was based on 1 ns Langevin dynamics simulation. The simulated structures were validated on the ensemble of experimentally determined unbound and bound structures. The set is intended for large scale benchmarking of docking algorithms and scoring functions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A radical expansion of the unbound protein docking benchmark set was achieved by simulating the unbound structures. The simulated unbound structures were selected according to criteria from systematic comparison of experimentally determined bound and unbound structures.

26927478,A polymer dataset for accelerated property prediction and design.,"Emerging computation- and data-driven approaches are particularly useful for rationally designing materials with targeted properties. Generally, these approaches rely on identifying structure-property relationships by learning from a dataset of sufficiently large number of relevant materials. The learned information can then be used to predict the properties of materials not already in the dataset, thus accelerating the materials design. Herein, we develop a dataset of 1,073 polymers and related materials and make it available at http://khazana.uconn.edu/. This dataset is uniformly prepared using first-principles calculations with structures obtained either from other sources or by using structure search methods. Because the immediate target of this work is to assist the design of high dielectric constant polymers, it is initially designed to include the optimized structures, atomization energies, band gaps, and dielectric constants. It will be progressively expanded by accumulating new materials and including additional properties calculated for the optimized structures provided.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,no notes; reassessed and not life sci,no notes; reassessed and re-scored - db but not life sci ?!

It has become increasingly appealing to use not only experimental structures but also homology models of unbound subunits as input for docking simulations. So far we are missing a large scale assessment of the success of rigid-body free docking methods on homology models.<h4>Results</h4>We explored how we could benefit from comparative modelling of unbound subunits to expand docking benchmark datasets. Starting from a collection of 3157 non-redundant, high X-ray resolution heterodimers, we developed the PPI4DOCK benchmark containing 1417 docking targets based on unbound homology models. Rigid-body docking by Zdock showed that for 1208 cases (85.2%), at least one correct decoy was generated, emphasizing the efficiency of rigid-body docking in generating correct assemblies. Overall, the PPI4DOCK benchmark contains a large set of realistic cases and provides new ground for assessing docking and scoring methodologies.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Benchmark sets can be downloaded from http://biodev.cea.fr/interevol/ppi4dock/ CONTACT: guerois@cea.frSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",benchmarking data available; reassessed and still yes - data available

Precise characterization of post-transcriptional regulatory maps has accelerated dramatically in the past few years. Based on new studies and resources, POSTAR supplies the largest collection of experimentally probed (~23 million) and computationally predicted (approximately 117 million) RBP binding sites in the human and mouse transcriptomes. POSTAR annotates every transcript and its RBP binding sites using extensive information regarding various molecular regulatory events (e.g., splicing, editing, and modification), RNA secondary structures, disease-associated variants, and gene expression and function. Moreover, POSTAR provides a friendly, multi-mode, integrated search interface, which helps users to connect multiple RBP binding sites with post-transcriptional regulatory events, phenotypes, and diseases. Based on our platform, we were able to obtain novel insights into post-transcriptional regulation, such as the putative association between CPSF6 binding, RNA structural domains, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome SNPs. In summary, POSTAR represents an early effort to systematically annotate post-transcriptional regulatory maps and explore the putative roles of RBPs in human diseases.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource","no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource, collection of binding sites"
28633399,The interfacial character of antibody paratopes: analysis of antibody-antigen structures.,"<h4>Summary</h4>In this study, computational methods are applied to investigate the general properties of antigen engaging residues of a paratope from a non-redundant dataset of 403 antibody-antigen complexes to dissect the contribution of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, van der Waals contacts and ionic interactions, as well as role of water molecules in the antigen-antibody interface. Consistent with previous reports using smaller datasets, we found that Tyr, Trp, Ser, Asn, Asp, Thr, Arg, Gly, His contribute substantially to the interactions between antibody and antigen. Furthermore, antibody-antigen interactions can be mediated by interfacial waters. However, there is no reported comprehensive analysis for a large number of structured waters that engage in higher ordered structures at the antibody-antigen interface. From our dataset, we have found the presence of interfacial waters in 242 complexes. We present evidence that suggests a compelling role of these interfacial waters in interactions of antibodies with a range of antigens differing in shape complementarity. Finally, we carry out 296 835 pairwise 3D structure comparisons of 771 structures of contact residues of antibodies with their interfacial water molecules from our dataset using CLICK method. A heuristic clustering algorithm is used to obtain unique structural similarities, and found to separate into 368 different clusters.

29155427,PDB-wide identification of biological assemblies from conserved quaternary structure geometry.,"Protein structures are key to understanding biomolecular mechanisms and diseases, yet their interpretation is hampered by limited knowledge of their biologically relevant quaternary structure (QS). A critical challenge in inferring QS information from crystallographic data is distinguishing biological interfaces from fortuitous crystal-packing contacts. Here, we tackled this problem by developing strategies for aligning and comparing QS states across both homologs and data repositories. QS conservation across homologs proved remarkably strong at predicting biological relevance and is implemented in two methods, QSalign and anti-QSalign, for annotating homo-oligomers and monomers, respectively. QS conservation across repositories is implemented in QSbio (http://www.QSbio.org), which approaches the accuracy of manual curation and allowed us to predict >100,000 QS states across the Protein Data Bank. Based on this high-quality data set, we analyzed pairs of structurally conserved interfaces, and this analysis revealed a striking plasticity whereby evolutionary distant interfaces maintain similar interaction geometries through widely divergent chemical properties.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,iffy; reassessed and re-scored - not clear from abstract what is available
29161266,Knowledge-based prediction of protein backbone conformation using a structural alphabet.,"Libraries of structural prototypes that abstract protein local structures are known as structural alphabets and have proven to be very useful in various aspects of protein structure analyses and predictions. One such library, Protein Blocks, is composed of 16 standard 5-residues long structural prototypes. This form of analyzing proteins involves drafting its structure as a string of Protein Blocks. Predicting the local structure of a protein in terms of protein blocks is the general objective of this work. A new approach, PB-kPRED is proposed towards this aim. It involves (i) organizing the structural knowledge in the form of a database of pentapeptide fragments extracted from all protein structures in the PDB and (ii) applying a knowledge-based algorithm that does not rely on any secondary structure predictions and/or sequence alignment profiles, to scan this database and predict most probable backbone conformations for the protein local structures. Though PB-kPRED uses the structural information from homologues in preference, if available. The predictions were evaluated rigorously on 15,544 query proteins representing a non-redundant subset of the PDB filtered at 30% sequence identity cut-off. We have shown that the kPRED method was able to achieve mean accuracies ranging from 40.8% to 66.3% depending on the availability of homologues. The impact of the different strategies for scanning the database on the prediction was evaluated and is discussed. Our results highlight the usefulness of the method in the context of proteins without any known structural homologues. A scoring function that gives a good estimate of the accuracy of prediction was further developed. This score estimates very well the accuracy of the algorithm (R2 of 0.82).

In 2014, the National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded an Administrative Supplement to the PhenX Toolkit (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures; https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/) to identify common measures to promote data comparability across SCD research. An 11-member Sickle Cell Disease Research and Scientific Panel provided guidance to the project, establishing a core collection of SCD-related measures and defining the scope of 2 specialty collections: (1) cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal complications, and (2) neurology, quality-of-life, and health services. For each specialty collection, a working group of SCD experts selected high-priority measures using a consensus process that included scientific community input. The SCD measures were released into the Toolkit in August 2015. The 25 measures included in the core collection are recommended for use by all NHLBI-funded investigators performing human-subject SCD research. The 10 neurology, quality-of-life, and health services measures and 14 cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal measures are recommended for use within these specialized research areas. For SCD and other researchers, PhenX measures will promote collaborations with clinicians and patients, facilitate cross-study analysis, accelerate translational research, and lead to greater understanding of SCD phenotypes and epigenetics. For clinicians, using PhenX measures will help elucidate the etiology, progression, and treatment of SCD, leading to improved patient care and quality of life.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,no notes; reassessed and re-scored - not a collection of data it seems
29351546,Accessing an Expanded Exposure Science Module at the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.,"SUMMARY:The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org) is a free resource that provides manually curated information on chemical, gene, phenotype, and disease relationships to advance understanding of the effect of environmental exposures on human health. Four core content areas are independently curated: chemical-gene interactions, chemical-disease and gene-disease associations, chemical-phenotype interactions, and environmental exposure data (e.g., effects of chemical stressors on humans). Since releasing exposure data in 2015, we have vastly increased our coverage of chemicals and disease/phenotype outcomes; greatly expanded access to exposure content; added search capability by stressors, cohorts, population demographics, and measured outcomes; and created user-specified displays of content. These enhancements aim to facilitate human studies by allowing comparisons among experimental parameters and across studies involving specified chemicals, populations, or outcomes. Integration of data among CTD's four content areas and external data sets, such as Gene Ontology annotations and pathway information, links exposure data with over 1.8 million chemical-gene, chemical-disease and gene-disease interactions. Our analysis tools reveal direct and inferred relationships among the data and provide opportunities to generate predictive connections between environmental exposures and population-level health outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2873.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource
29990104,A Robust 3D-2D Interactive Tool for Scene Segmentation and Annotation.,"Recent advances of 3D acquisition devices have enabled large-scale acquisition of 3D scene data. Such data, if completely and well annotated, can serve as useful ingredients for a wide spectrum of computer vision and graphics works such as data-driven modeling and scene understanding, object detection and recognition. However, annotating a vast amount of 3D scene data remains challenging due to the lack of an effective tool and/or the complexity of 3D scenes (e.g. clutter, varying illumination conditions). This paper aims to build a robust annotation tool that effectively and conveniently enables the segmentation and annotation of massive 3D data. Our tool works by coupling 2D and 3D information via an interactive framework, through which users can provide high-level semantic annotation for objects. We have experimented our tool and found that a typical indoor scene could be well segmented and annotated in less than 30 minutes by using the tool, as opposed to a few hours if done manually. Along with the tool, we created a dataset of over a hundred 3D scenes associated with complete annotations using our tool.

30714210,Functional Evolution of Proteins.,"The functional evolution of proteins advances through gene duplication followed by functional drift, whereas molecular evolution occurs through random mutational events. Over time, protein active-site structures or functional epitopes remain highly conserved, which enables relationships to be inferred between distant orthologs or paralogs. In this study, we present the first functional clustering and evolutionary analysis of the RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) based on similarities between active-site structures. All of the ligand-bound proteins within the RCSB PDB were scored using our Comparison of Protein Active-site Structures (CPASS) software and database (http://cpass.unl.edu/). Principal component analysis was then used to identify 4431 representative structures to construct a phylogenetic tree based on the CPASS comparative scores (http://itol.embl.de/shared/jcatazaro). The resulting phylogenetic tree identified a sequential, step-wise evolution of protein active-sites and provides novel insights into the emergence of protein function or changes in substrate specificity based on subtle changes in geometry and amino acid composition.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,no notes; reassessed and re-scored - don't think the data is there - it only refs other resources

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional dysbiosis in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile acids, and short-chain fatty acids), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation. The study's infrastructure resources, results, and data, which are available through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database ( http://ibdmdb.org ), provide the most comprehensive description to date of host and microbial activities in inflammatory bowel diseases.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource

Two commonly used mouse models were utilized: a reversible chemical-induced injury model (folic acid (FA) induced nephropathy) and an irreversible surgically-induced fibrosis model (unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)). mRNA and small RNA sequencing, as well as 10-plex tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomics were performed with kidney samples from different time points over the course of fibrosis development. The bioinformatics workflow used to process, technically validate, and combine the single omics data will be described. In summary, we present temporal multi-omics data from fibrotic mouse kidneys that are accessible through an interrogation tool (Mouse Kidney Fibromics browser) to provide a searchable transcriptome and proteome for kidney fibrosis researchers.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"tentative 1; Very small, is it a biodata resource?; reassessed, we have included similar datasets",no notes; reassessed and still yes - data set available

Many of these studies are based on mass spectrometry proteomics data and describe comparison of the abundance of proteins in cerebrospinal fluid between two or more disease groups. As the number of such studies is growing, it is no longer straightforward to obtain an overview of which specific proteins are increased or decreased between the numerous relevant diseases and their many subcategories, or to see the larger picture or trends between related diseases. To alleviate this situation, we therefore mined the literature for mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies including quantitative protein data from cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease and organized the extracted data in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Resource (CSF-PR). CSF-PR is freely available online at http://probe.uib.no/csf-pr , is highly interactive, and allows for easy navigation, visualization, and export of the published scientific data.

31950241,Evaluating genetic causes of azoospermia: What can we learn from a complex cellular structure and single-cell transcriptomics of the human testis?,"Azoospermia is a condition defined as the absence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate, but the testicular phenotype of men with azoospermia may be very variable, ranging from full spermatogenesis, through arrested maturation of germ cells at different stages, to completely degenerated tissue with ghost tubules. Hence, information regarding the cell-type-specific expression patterns is needed to prioritise potential pathogenic variants that contribute to the pathogenesis of azoospermia. Thanks to technological advances within next-generation sequencing, it is now possible to obtain detailed cell-type-specific expression patterns in the testis by single-cell RNA sequencing. However, to interpret single-cell RNA sequencing data properly, substantial knowledge of the highly sophisticated data processing and visualisation methods is needed. Here we review the complex cellular structure of the human testis in different types of azoospermia and outline how known genetic alterations affect the pathology of the testis. We combined the currently available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets originating from the human testis into one dataset covering 62,751 testicular cells, each with a median of 2637 transcripts quantified. We show what effects the most common data-processing steps have, and how different visualisation methods can be used. Furthermore, we calculated expression patterns in pseudotime, and show how splicing rates can be used to determine the velocity of differentiation during spermatogenesis. With the combined dataset we show expression patterns and network analysis of genes known to be involved in the pathogenesis of azoospermia. Finally, we provide the combined dataset as an interactive online resource where expression of genes and different visualisation methods can be explored ( https://testis.cells.ucsc.edu/ ).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,no notes; reassessed and re-scored - data but seems to be viz only
32392296,CoCoCoNet: conserved and comparative co-expression across a diverse set of species.,"Co-expression analysis has provided insight into gene function in organisms from Arabidopsis to zebrafish. Comparison across species has the potential to enrich these results, for example by prioritizing among candidate human disease genes based on their network properties or by finding alternative model systems where their co-expression is conserved. Here, we present CoCoCoNet as a tool for identifying conserved gene modules and comparing co-expression networks. CoCoCoNet is a resource for both data and methods, providing gold standard networks and sophisticated tools for on-the-fly comparative analyses across 14 species. We show how CoCoCoNet can be used in two use cases. In the first, we demonstrate deep conservation of a nucleolus gene module across very divergent organisms, and in the second, we show how the heterogeneity of autism mechanisms in humans can be broken down by functional groups and translated to model organisms.

32765587,ABC-GWAS: Functional Annotation of Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Genetic Variants.,"Over the past decade, hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated genetic variants in various diseases, including cancer. However, only a few of these variants have been functionally characterized to date, mainly because the majority of the variants reside in non-coding regions of the human genome with unknown function. A comprehensive functional annotation of the candidate variants is thus necessary to fill the gap between the correlative findings of GWAS and the development of therapeutic strategies. By integrating large-scale multi-omics datasets such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), we performed multivariate linear regression analysis of expression quantitative trait loci, sequence permutation test of transcription factor binding perturbation, and modeling of three-dimensional chromatin interactions to analyze the potential molecular functions of 2,813 single nucleotide variants in 93 genomic loci associated with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. To facilitate rapid progress in functional genomics of breast cancer, we have created """"Analysis of Breast Cancer GWAS"""" (ABC-GWAS), an interactive database of functional annotation of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer GWAS variants. Our resource includes expression quantitative trait loci, long-range chromatin interaction predictions, and transcription factor binding motif analyses to prioritize putative target genes, causal variants, and transcription factors. An embedded genome browser also facilitates convenient visualization of the GWAS loci in genomic and epigenomic context. ABC-GWAS provides an interactive visual summary of comprehensive functional characterization of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer variants. The web resource will be useful to both computational and experimental biologists who wish to generate and test their hypotheses regarding the genetic susceptibility, etiology, and carcinogenesis of breast cancer. ABC-GWAS can also be used as a user-friendly educational resource for teaching functional genomics.

33177514,"SAVI, in silico generation of billions of easily synthesizable compounds through expert-system type rules.","We have made available a database of over 1 billion compounds predicted to be easily synthesizable, called Synthetically Accessible Virtual Inventory (SAVI). They have been created by a set of transforms based on an adaptation and extension of the CHMTRN/PATRAN programming languages describing chemical synthesis expert knowledge, which originally stem from the LHASA project. The chemoinformatics toolkit CACTVS was used to apply a total of 53 transforms to about 150,000 readily available building blocks (enamine.net). Only single-step, two-reactant syntheses were calculated for this database even though the technology can execute multi-step reactions. The possibility to incorporate scoring systems in CHMTRN allowed us to subdivide the database of 1.75 billion compounds in sets according to their predicted synthesizability, with the most-synthesizable class comprising 1.09 billion synthetic products. Properties calculated for all SAVI products show that the database should be well-suited for drug discovery.

33391232,Creation of an Online Platform for Identification of Microorganisms: Peak Picking or Full-Spectrum Analysis.,"Identification of microorganisms by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a very efficient method with high throughput, speed, and accuracy. However, it is significantly limited by the absence of a universal database of reference mass spectra. This problem can be solved by creating an Internet platform for open databases of protein spectra of microorganisms. Choosing the optimal mathematical apparatus is the pivotal issue for this task. In our previous study we proposed the geometric approach for processing mass spectrometry data, which represented a mass spectrum as a vector in a multidimensional Euclidean space. This algorithm was implemented in a Jacob4 stand-alone package. We demonstrated its efficiency in delimiting two closely related species of the <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> group. In this study, the geometric approach was realized as R scripts which allowed us to design a Web-based application. We also studied the possibility of using full spectra analysis (FSA) without calculating mass peaks (PPA), which is the logical development of the method. We used 74 microbial strains from the collections of ICiG SB RAS, UNIQEM, IEGM, KMM, and VGM as the models. We demonstrated that the algorithms based on peak-picking and analysis of complete data have accuracy no less than that of Biotyper 3.1 software. We proposed a method for calculating cut-off thresholds based on averaged intraspecific distances. The resulting database, raw data, and the set of R scripts are available online at https://icg-test.mydisk.nsc.ru/s/qj6cfZg57g6qwzN.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - software and includes a data resource
33620450,VoroCNN: Deep convolutional neural network built on 3D Voronoi tessellation of protein structures.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Effective use of evolutionary information has recently led to tremendous progress in computational prediction of three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins and their complexes. Despite the progress, the accuracy of predicted structures tends to vary considerably from case to case. Since the utility of computational models depends on their accuracy, reliable estimates of deviation between predicted and native structures are of utmost importance.<h4>Results</h4>For the first time, we present a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) constructed on a Voronoi tessellation of 3D molecular structures. Despite the irregular data domain, our data representation allows us to efficiently introduce both convolution and pooling operations and train the network in an end-to-end fashion without precomputed descriptors. The resultant model, VoroCNN, predicts local qualities of 3D protein folds. The prediction results are competitive to state of the art and superior to the previous 3D CNN architectures built for the same task. We also discuss practical applications of VoroCNN, for example, in recognition of protein binding interfaces.<h4>Availability</h4>The model, data, and evaluation tests are available at https://team.inria.fr/nano-d/software/vorocnn/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,no notes; reassessed and re-scored - model
33789926,A Novel Three-Choice Touchscreen Task to Examine Spatial Attention and Orienting Responses in Rodents.,"Mammalian orienting behavior consists of coordinated movements of the eyes, head, pinnae, vibrissae, or body to attend to an external stimulus. The present study aimed to develop a novel operant task using a touch-screen system to measure spatial attention. In this task, rats were trained to nose-poke a light stimulus presented in one of three locations. The stimulus was presented more frequently in the center location to develop spatial attention bias toward the center stimulus. Changes in orienting responses were detected by measuring the animals' response accuracy and latency to stimuli at the lateral locations, following reversible unilateral chemogenetic inactivation of the superior colliculus (SC). Additionally, spontaneous turning and rotation behavior was measured using an open-field test (OFT). Our results show that right SC inactivation significantly increased the whole body turn angle in the OFT, in line with previous literature that indicated an ipsiversive orientating bias and the presence of contralateral neglect following unilateral SC lesions. In the touch screen orienting task, unilateral SC inactivation significantly increased bias toward the ipsilateral side, as measured by response frequency in various experimental conditions, and a very large left-shift of a respective psychometric function. Our results demonstrate that this novel touchscreen task is able to detect changes in spatial attention and orienting responses because of e.g. experimental manipulations or injury with very high sensitivity, while taking advantage of the touch screen technology that allows for high transferability of the task between labs and for open-source data sharing through https://www.mousebytes.ca.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,"yes,  not well conveyed in the abstract; reassessed and re-scored - not clear if they created or used a data resource"
34015823,COVID-19 biomarkers and their overlap with comorbidities in a disease biomarker data model.,"In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, scientists and medical researchers are capturing a wide range of host responses, symptoms and lingering postrecovery problems within the human population. These variable clinical manifestations suggest differences in influential factors, such as innate and adaptive host immunity, existing or underlying health conditions, comorbidities, genetics and other factors-compounding the complexity of COVID-19 pathobiology and potential biomarkers associated with the disease, as they become available. The heterogeneous data pose challenges for efficient extrapolation of information into clinical applications. We have curated 145 COVID-19 biomarkers by developing a novel cross-cutting disease biomarker data model that allows integration and evaluation of biomarkers in patients with comorbidities. Most biomarkers are related to the immune (SAA, TNF-<U+221D> and IP-10) or coagulation (D-dimer, antithrombin and VWF) cascades, suggesting complex vascular pathobiology of the disease. Furthermore, we observe commonality with established cancer biomarkers (ACE2, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-2) as well as biomarkers for metabolic syndrome and diabetes (CRP, NLR and LDL). We explore these trends as we put forth a COVID-19 biomarker resource (https://data.oncomx.org/covid19) that will help researchers and diagnosticians alike.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,no notes; reassessed and re-scored - not clear if model and data
IND607223097,Characterization of transcriptomes from sexual and asexual lineages of a New Zealand snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum),"Understanding the evolution and maintenance of sexual reproduction is one of the central challenges of evolutionary biology, yet we know very little about how sex influences molecular evolution. The New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum is ideally suited to address this knowledge gap because obligately sexual individuals often coexist with multiple independently derived obligately asexual lineages. This unusual situation allows direct comparisons both between sexual and asexual P. antipodarum and across populations that differ in the relative frequency of sexual individuals. As such, P. antipodarum has received a great deal of attention as a model system for the maintenance of sex in nature and is also used as a model for environmental toxicology and biological invasions. Molecular genetic resources for P. antipodarum will thus be useful to investigators in a variety of biological fields. We used 454 sequencing of cDNA libraries to generate transcriptomes from two sexual and two asexual P. antipodarum lineages. A de novo assembly of 116.7�Mb of sequence reads produced 41�396 contigs, and sequence similarity-based Gene Ontology annotations were obtained for 3740 contigs. We detected 408�315 SNP loci and 7315 microsatellite loci, which together represent the first genome-scale resource available for P. antipodarum. Raw 454 read sequences, contig sequences, annotation data and polymorphism data are publicly available in a searchable online database and for download at http://www.biology.uiowa.edu/neiman/transcriptome.php.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource

The algorithm is capable of providing accurate quantitative values and increased recall at a controlled false discovery rate, in a complex gold standard dataset. Importantly, we further demonstrate increased confidence gained by the use of two complementary data-independent acquisition targeted analysis algorithms, as well as increased numbers of quantified peptide precursors in complex biological samples.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>DIANA is implemented in scala and python and available as open source (Apache 2.0 license) or pre-compiled binaries from http://quantitativeproteomics.org/diana.

We have divided the allowed (F, <U+03A8>) space in Ramachandran maps into 27 distinct conformations sufficient to regenerate a structure to within 5 � from the native, at least for small proteins, thus reducing the structure prediction problem to a specification of an alphanumeric string, i.e., the amino acid sequence together with one of the 27 conformations preferred by each amino acid residue. This still theoretically results in 27(n) conformations for a protein comprising """"n"""" amino acids. We then investigated the spatial correlations at the two-residue (dipeptide) and three-residue (tripeptide) levels in what may be described as higher order Ramachandran maps, with the premise that the allowed conformational space starts to shrink as we introduce neighborhood effects. We found, for instance, for a tripeptide which potentially can exist in any of the 27(3) """"allowed"""" conformations, three-fourths of these conformations are redundant to the 95% confidence level, suggesting sequence context dependent preferred conformations. We then created a look-up table of preferred conformations at the tripeptide level and correlated them with energetically favorable conformations. We found in particular that Boltzmann probabilities calculated from van der Waals energies for each conformation of tripeptides correlate well with the observed populations in the structural database (the average correlation coefficient is ~0.8). An alpha-numeric string and hence the tertiary structure can be generated for any sequence from the look-up table within minutes on a single processor and to a higher level of accuracy if secondary structure can be specified. We tested the methodology on 100 small proteins, and in 90% of the cases, a structure within 5 � is recovered. We thus believe that the method presented here provides the missing link between Ramachandran maps and tertiary structures of proteins. A Web server to convert a tertiary structure to an alphanumeric string and to predict the tertiary structure from the sequence of a protein using the above methodology is created and made freely accessible at http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/proteomics/rm2ts.jsp.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21208984,Model selection in Bayesian segmentation of multiple DNA alignments.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The analysis of multiple sequence alignments is allowing researchers to glean valuable insights into evolution, as well as identify genomic regions that may be functional, or discover novel classes of functional elements. Understanding the distribution of conservation levels that constitutes the evolutionary landscape is crucial to distinguishing functional regions from non-functional. Recent evidence suggests that a binary classification of evolutionary rates is inappropriate for this purpose and finds only highly conserved functional elements. Given that the distribution of evolutionary rates is multi-modal, determining the number of modes is of paramount concern. Through simulation, we evaluate the performance of a number of information criterion approaches derived from MCMC simulations in determining the dimension of a model.<h4>Results</h4>We utilize a deviance information criterion (DIC) approximation that is more robust than the approximations from other information criteria, and show our information criteria approximations do not produce superfluous modes when estimating conservation distributions under a variety of circumstances. We analyse the distribution of conservation for a multiple alignment comprising four primate species and mouse, and repeat this on two additional multiple alignments of similar species. We find evidence of six distinct classes of evolutionary rates that appear to be robust to the species used.<h4>Availability</h4>Source code and data are available at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/477240/changept.zip.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data available but on dropbox
21226895,Shape-based peak identification for ChIP-Seq.,"<h4>Background</h4>The identification of binding targets for proteins using ChIP-Seq has gained popularity as an alternative to ChIP-chip. Sequencing can, in principle, eliminate artifacts associated with microarrays, and cheap sequencing offers the ability to sequence deeply and obtain a comprehensive survey of binding. A number of algorithms have been developed to call """"peaks"""" representing bound regions from mapped reads. Most current algorithms incorporate multiple heuristics, and despite much work it remains difficult to accurately determine individual peaks corresponding to distinct binding events.<h4>Results</h4>Our method for identifying statistically significant peaks from read coverage is inspired by the notion of persistence in topological data analysis and provides a non-parametric approach that is statistically sound and robust to noise in experiments. Specifically, our method reduces the peak calling problem to the study of tree-based statistics derived from the data. We validate our approach using previously published data and show that it can discover previously missed regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The difficulty in accurately calling peaks for ChIP-Seq data is partly due to the difficulty in defining peaks, and we demonstrate a novel method that improves on the accuracy of previous methods in resolving peaks. Our introduction of a robust statistical test based on ideas from topological data analysis is also novel. Our methods are implemented in a program called T-PIC (Tree shape Peak Identification for ChIP-Seq) is available at http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/tpic/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Although there are more than 750 active registered servers from around 50 organizations, setting up a DAS server comprises a fair amount of work, making it difficult for many research groups to share their biological annotations. Given the clear advantage that the generalized sharing of relevant biological data is for the research community it would be desirable to facilitate the sharing process.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present easyDAS, a web-based system enabling anyone to publish biological annotations with just some clicks. The system, available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/panda-srv/easydas is capable of reading different standard data file formats, process the data and create a new publicly available DAS source in a completely automated way. The created sources are hosted on the EBI systems and can take advantage of its high storage capacity and network connection, freeing the data provider from any network management work. easyDAS is an open source project under the GNU LGPL license.<h4>Conclusions</h4>easyDAS is an automated DAS source creation system which can help many researchers in sharing their biological data, potentially increasing the amount of relevant biological data available to the scientific community.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21266443,An efficient hierarchical generalized linear mixed model for pathway analysis of genome-wide association studies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex diseases, genetic variants having real but weak associations often fail to be detected at the stringent genome-wide significance level. Pathway analysis, which tests disease association with combined association signals from a group of variants in the same pathway, has become increasingly popular. However, because of the complexities in genetic data and the large sample sizes in typical GWAS, pathway analysis remains to be challenging. We propose a new statistical model for pathway analysis of GWAS. This model includes a fixed effects component that models mean disease association for a group of genes, and a random effects component that models how each gene's association with disease varies about the gene group mean, thus belongs to the class of mixed effects models.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed model is computationally efficient and uses only summary statistics. In addition, it corrects for the presence of overlapping genes and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Via simulated and real GWAS data, we showed our model improved power over currently available pathway analysis methods while preserving type I error rate. Furthermore, using the WTCCC Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) dataset, we demonstrated mixed model analysis identified meaningful biological processes that agreed well with previous reports on T1D. Therefore, the proposed methodology provides an efficient statistical modeling framework for systems analysis of GWAS.<h4>Availability</h4>The software code for mixed models analysis is freely available at http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/LilyWang.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21278116,"Predicting breed composition using breed frequencies of 50,000 markers from the US Meat Animal Research Center 2,000 Bull Project.","Knowledge of breed composition can be useful in multiple aspects of cattle production, and can be critical for analyzing the results of whole genome-wide association studies currently being conducted around the world. We examine the feasibility and accuracy of using genotype data from the most prevalent bovine genome-wide association studies platform, the Illumina BovineSNP50 array (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA), to estimate breed composition for individual breeds of cattle. First, allele frequencies (of Illumina-defined allele B) of SNP on the array for each of 16 beef cattle breeds were defined by genotyping a large set of more than 2,000 bulls selected in cooperation with the respective breed associations to be representative of their breed. With these breed-specific allele frequencies, the breed compositions of approximately 2,000 two-, three-, and four-way cross (of 8 breeds) cattle produced at the US Meat Animal Research Center were predicted by using a simple multiple regression technique or Mendel (http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/mendel) and their genotypes from the Illumina BovineSNP50 array, and were then compared with pedigree-based estimates of breed composition. The accuracy of marker-based breed composition estimates was 89% when using either estimation method for all breeds except Angus and Red Angus (averaged 79%), based on comparing estimates with pedigree-based average breed composition. Accuracy increased to approximately 88% when these 2 breeds were combined into an aggregate Angus group. Additionally, we used a subset of these markers, approximately 3,000 that populate the Illumina Bovine3K (Illumina Inc.), to see whether breed composition could be estimated with similar accuracy when using this reduced panel of SNP makers. When breed composition was estimated using only SNP in common with the Bovine 3K array, accuracy was slightly reduced to 83%. These results suggest that SNP data from these arrays could be used to estimate breed composition in most US beef cattle in situations where pedigree is not known (e.g., multiple-sire natural service matings, non-source-verified animals in feedlots or at slaughter). This approach can aid analyses that depend on knowledge of breed composition, including identification and adjustment of breed-based population stratification, when performing genome-wide association studies on populations with incomplete pedigrees. In addition, SNP-based breed composition estimates may facilitate fitting cow germplasm to the environment, managing cattle in the feedlot, and tracing disease cases back to the geographic region or farm of origin.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Here, we survey the field of high-throughput methods for 3-D structure prediction and set up new target specifications for the next generation of methods. We then introduce COSMOS, a novel data-driven prediction method that utilizes libraries of fragment and torsion angle parameters. We illustrate COSMOS using parameters extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) by analyzing their distribution and then evaluating the system's performance in terms of speed, coverage, and accuracy. Results show that COSMOS represents a significant improvement when compared to state-of-the-art prediction methods, particularly in terms of coverage of complex molecular structures, including metal-organics. COSMOS can predict structures for 96.4% of the molecules in the CSD (99.6% organic, 94.6% metal-organic), whereas the widely used commercial method CORINA predicts structures for 68.5% (98.5% organic, 51.6% metal-organic). On the common subset of molecules predicted by both methods, COSMOS makes predictions with an average speed per molecule of 0.15 s (0.10 s organic, 0.21 s metal-organic) and an average rmsd of 1.57 � (1.26 � organic, 1.90 � metal-organic), and CORINA makes predictions with an average speed per molecule of 0.13s (0.18s organic, 0.08s metal-organic) and an average rmsd of 1.60 � (1.13 � organic, 2.11 � metal-organic).

21467251,Patient-specific radiation dose and cancer risk for pediatric chest CT.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To estimate patient-specific radiation dose and cancer risk for pediatric chest computed tomography (CT) and to evaluate factors affecting dose and risk, including patient size, patient age, and scanning parameters.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The institutional review board approved this study and waived informed consent. This study was HIPAA compliant. The study included 30 patients (0-16 years old), for whom full-body computer models were recently created from clinical CT data. A validated Monte Carlo program was used to estimate organ dose from eight chest protocols, representing clinically relevant combinations of bow tie filter, collimation, pitch, and tube potential. Organ dose was used to calculate effective dose and risk index (an index of total cancer incidence risk). The dose and risk estimates before and after normalization by volume-weighted CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) or dose-length product (DLP) were correlated with patient size and age. The effect of each scanning parameter was studied.<h4>Results</h4>Organ dose normalized by tube current-time product or CTDI(vol) decreased exponentially with increasing average chest diameter. Effective dose normalized by tube current-time product or DLP decreased exponentially with increasing chest diameter. Chest diameter was a stronger predictor of dose than weight and total scan length. Risk index normalized by tube current-time product or DLP decreased exponentially with both chest diameter and age. When normalized by DLP, effective dose and risk index were independent of collimation, pitch, and tube potential (<10% variation).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The correlations of dose and risk with patient size and age can be used to estimate patient-specific dose and risk. They can further guide the design and optimization of pediatric chest CT protocols.<h4>Supplemental material</h4>http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101900/-/DC1.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21467568,Increasing power of genome-wide association studies by collecting additional single-nucleotide polymorphisms.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been effectively identifying the genomic regions associated with a disease trait. In a typical GWAS, an informative subset of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), called tag SNPs, is genotyped in case/control individuals. Once the tag SNP statistics are computed, the genomic regions that are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the most significantly associated tag SNPs are believed to contain the causal polymorphisms. However, such LD regions are often large and contain many additional polymorphisms. Following up all the SNPs included in these regions is costly and infeasible for biological validation. In this article we address how to characterize these regions cost effectively with the goal of providing investigators a clear direction for biological validation. We introduce a follow-up study approach for identifying all untyped associated SNPs by selecting additional SNPs, called follow-up SNPs, from the associated regions and genotyping them in the original case/control individuals. We introduce a novel SNP selection method with the goal of maximizing the number of associated SNPs among the chosen follow-up SNPs. We show how the observed statistics of the original tag SNPs and human genetic variation reference data such as the HapMap Project can be utilized to identify the follow-up SNPs. We use simulated and real association studies based on the HapMap data and the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium to demonstrate that our method shows superior performance to the correlation- and distance-based traditional follow-up SNP selection approaches.

21496265,SNP-based pathway enrichment analysis for genome-wide association studies.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recently we have witnessed a surge of interest in using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to discover the genetic basis of complex diseases. Many genetic variations, mostly in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been identified in a wide spectrum of diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and psychiatric diseases. A common theme arising from these studies is that the genetic variations discovered by GWAS can only explain a small fraction of the genetic risks associated with the complex diseases. New strategies and statistical approaches are needed to address this lack of explanation. One such approach is the pathway analysis, which considers the genetic variations underlying a biological pathway, rather than separately as in the traditional GWAS studies. A critical challenge in the pathway analysis is how to combine evidences of association over multiple SNPs within a gene and multiple genes within a pathway. Most current methods choose the most significant SNP from each gene as a representative, ignoring the joint action of multiple SNPs within a gene. This approach leads to preferential identification of genes with a greater number of SNPs.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a SNP-based pathway enrichment method for GWAS studies. The method consists of the following two main steps: 1) for a given pathway, using an adaptive truncated product statistic to identify all representative (potentially more than one) SNPs of each gene, calculating the average number of representative SNPs for the genes, then re-selecting the representative SNPs of genes in the pathway based on this number; and 2) ranking all selected SNPs by the significance of their statistical association with a trait of interest, and testing if the set of SNPs from a particular pathway is significantly enriched with high ranks using a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We applied our method to two large genetically distinct GWAS data sets of schizophrenia, one from European-American (EA) and the other from African-American (AA). In the EA data set, we found 22 pathways with nominal P-value less than or equal to 0.001 and corresponding false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5%. In the AA data set, we found 11 pathways by controlling the same nominal P-value and FDR threshold. Interestingly, 8 of these pathways overlap with those found in the EA sample. We have implemented our method in a JAVA software package, called SNP Set Enrichment Analysis (SSEA), which contains a user-friendly interface and is freely available at http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/SSEA.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The SNP-based pathway enrichment method described here offers a new alternative approach for analysing GWAS data. By applying it to schizophrenia GWAS studies, we show that our method is able to identify statistically significant pathways, and importantly, pathways that can be replicated in large genetically distinct samples.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21546392,Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE): a web-based RNA alignment tool.,"<h4>Summary</h4>The explosion of interest in non-coding RNAs, together with improvements in RNA X-ray crystallography, has led to a rapid increase in RNA structures at atomic resolution from 847 in 2005 to 1900 in 2010. The success of whole-genome sequencing has led to an explosive growth of unaligned homologous sequences. Consequently, there is a compelling and urgent need for user-friendly tools for producing structure-informed RNA alignments. Most alignment software considers the primary sequence alone; some specialized alignment software can also include Watson-Crick base pairs, but none adequately addresses the needs introduced by the rapid influx of both sequence and structural data. Therefore, we have developed the Boulder ALignment Editor (ALE), which is a web-based RNA alignment editor, designed for editing and assessing alignments using structural information. Some features of BoulderALE include the annotation and evaluation of an alignment based on isostericity of Watson-Crick and non-Watson-Crick base pairs, along with the collapsing (horizontally and vertically) of the alignment, while maintaining the ability to edit the alignment.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.microbio.me/boulderale.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21554765,Enhancing genome assemblies by integrating non-sequence based data.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Many genome projects were underway before the advent of high-throughput sequencing and have thus been supported by a wealth of genome information from other technologies. Such information frequently takes the form of linkage and physical maps, both of which can provide a substantial amount of data useful in de novo sequencing projects. Furthermore, the recent abundance of genome resources enables the use of conserved synteny maps identified in related species to further enhance genome assemblies.<h4>Methods</h4>The tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) is a model marsupial mammal with a low coverage genome. However, we have access to extensive comparative maps containing over 14,000 markers constructed through the physical mapping of conserved loci, chromosome painting and comprehensive linkage maps. Using a custom Bioperl pipeline, information from the maps was aligned to assembled tammar wallaby contigs using BLAT. This data was used to construct pseudo paired-end libraries with intervals ranging from 5-10 MB. We then used Bambus (a program designed to scaffold eukaryotic genomes by ordering and orienting contigs through the use of paired-end data) to scaffold our libraries. To determine how map data compares to sequence based approaches to enhance assemblies, we repeated the experiment using a 0.5� coverage of unique reads from 4 KB and 8 KB Illumina paired-end libraries. Finally, we combined both the sequence and non-sequence-based data to determine how a combined approach could further enhance the quality of the low coverage de novo reconstruction of the tammar wallaby genome.<h4>Results</h4>Using the map data alone, we were able order 2.2% of the initial contigs into scaffolds, and increase the N50 scaffold size to 39 KB (36 KB in the original assembly). Using only the 0.5� paired-end sequence based data, 53% of the initial contigs were assigned to scaffolds. Combining both data sets resulted in a further 2% increase in the number of initial contigs integrated into a scaffold (55% total) but a 35% increase in N50 scaffold size over the use of sequence-based data alone.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We provide a relatively simple pipeline utilizing existing bioinformatics tools to integrate map data into a genome assembly which is available at http://www.mcb.uconn.edu/fac.php?name=paska. While the map data only contributed minimally to assigning the initial contigs to scaffolds in the new assembly, it greatly increased the N50 size. This process added structure to our low coverage assembly, greatly increasing its utility in further analyses.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

These guidelines were periodically updated in past years.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the 2009 update of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence (UI).<h4>Evidence acquisition</h4>The EAU working panel was part of the 4th International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) and, with permission of the ICI, extracted the relevant data. The methodology of the 4th ICI was a comprehensive literature review by international experts and consensus formation. In addition, level of evidence was rated according to a modified Oxford system and grades of recommendation were given accordingly.<h4>Evidence summary</h4>A full version of the EAU guidelines on urinary incontinence is available as a printed document (extended and short form) and as a CD-ROM from the EAU office or online from the EAU Web site (http://www.uroweb.org/guidelines/online-guidelines/). The extent and invasiveness of assessment of UI depends on severity and/or complexity of symptoms and clinical signs and is different for men, women, frail older persons, children, and patients with neuropathy. At the level of initial management, basic diagnostic tests are applied to exclude an underlying disease or condition such as urinary tract infection. Treatment is mostly conservative (lifestyle interventions, physiotherapy, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) and is of an empirical nature. At the level of specialised management (when primary therapy failed, diagnosis is unclear, or symptoms and/or signs are complex/severe),more elaborate assessment is generally required, including imaging, endoscopy, and urodynamics. Treatment options include invasive interventions and surgery.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Treatment options for UI are rapidly expanding. These EAU guidelines provide ratings of the evidence (guided by evidence-based medicine) and graded recommendations for the appropriate assessment and according treatment options and put them into clinical perspective.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21624157,How orthogonal are the OBO Foundry ontologies?,"<h4>Background</h4>Ontologies in biomedicine facilitate information integration, data exchange, search and query of biomedical data, and other critical knowledge-intensive tasks. The OBO Foundry is a collaborative effort to establish a set of principles for ontology development with the eventual goal of creating a set of interoperable reference ontologies in the domain of biomedicine. One of the key requirements to achieve this goal is to ensure that ontology developers reuse term definitions that others have already created rather than create their own definitions, thereby making the ontologies orthogonal.<h4>Methods</h4>We used a simple lexical algorithm to analyze the extent to which the set of OBO Foundry candidate ontologies identified from September 2009 to September 2010 conforms to this vision. Specifically, we analyzed (1) the level of explicit term reuse in this set of ontologies, (2) the level of overlap, where two ontologies define similar terms independently, and (3) how the levels of reuse and overlap changed during the course of this year.<h4>Results</h4>We found that 30% of the ontologies reuse terms from other Foundry candidates and 96% of the candidate ontologies contain terms that overlap with terms from the other ontologies. We found that while term reuse increased among the ontologies between September 2009 and September 2010, the level of overlap among the ontologies remained relatively constant. Additionally, we analyzed the six ontologies announced as OBO Foundry members on March 5, 2010, and identified that the level of overlap was extremely low, but, notably, so was the level of term reuse.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have created a prototype web application that allows OBO Foundry ontology developers to see which classes from their ontologies overlap with classes from other ontologies in the OBO Foundry (http://obomap.bioontology.org). From our analysis, we conclude that while the OBO Foundry has made significant progress toward orthogonality during the period of this study through increased adoption of explicit term reuse, a large amount of overlap remains among these ontologies. Furthermore, the characteristics of the identified overlap, such as the terms it comprises and its distribution among the ontologies, indicate that the achieving orthogonality will be exceptionally difficult, if not impossible.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,for analysis only it seems
21685100,Piecewise linear approximation of protein structures using the principle of minimum message length.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Simple and concise representations of protein-folding patterns provide powerful abstractions for visualizations, comparisons, classifications, searching and aligning structural data. Structures are often abstracted by replacing standard secondary structural features-that is, helices and strands of sheet-by vectors or linear segments. Relying solely on standard secondary structure may result in a significant loss of structural information. Further, traditional methods of simplification crucially depend on the consistency and accuracy of external methods to assign secondary structures to protein coordinate data. Although many methods exist automatically to identify secondary structure, the impreciseness of definitions, along with errors and inconsistencies in experimental structure data, drastically limit their applicability to generate reliable simplified representations, especially for structural comparison. This article introduces a mathematically rigorous algorithm to delineate protein structure using the elegant statistical and inductive inference framework of minimum message length (MML). Our method generates consistent and statistically robust piecewise linear explanations of protein coordinate data, resulting in a powerful and concise representation of the structure. The delineation is completely independent of the approaches of using hydrogen-bonding patterns or inspecting local substructural geometry that the current methods use. Indeed, as is common with applications of the MML criterion, this method is free of parameters and thresholds, in striking contrast to the existing programs which are often beset by them. The analysis of results over a large number of proteins suggests that the method produces consistent delineation of structures that encompasses, among others, the segments corresponding to standard secondary structure.<h4>Availability</h4>http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~karun/pmml.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

There are more than 1000 DAS sources available and the number is steadily increasing. Clients are an essential part of the DAS system and integrate data from several independent sources in order to create a useful representation to the user. While web-based DAS clients exist, most of them do not have direct interaction capabilities such as dragging and zooming with the mouse.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present GenExp, a web based and fully interactive visual DAS client. GenExp is a genome oriented DAS client capable of creating informative representations of genomic data zooming out from base level to complete chromosomes. It proposes a novel approach to genomic data rendering and uses the latest HTML5 web technologies to create the data representation inside the client browser. Thanks to client-side rendering most position changes do not need a network request to the server and so responses to zooming and panning are almost immediate. In GenExp it is possible to explore the genome intuitively moving it with the mouse just like geographical map applications. Additionally, in GenExp it is possible to have more than one data viewer at the same time and to save the current state of the application to revisit it later on.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GenExp is a new interactive web-based client for DAS and addresses some of the short-comings of the existing clients. It uses client-side data rendering techniques resulting in easier genome browsing and exploration.

Combined with the high-throughput of next-generation sequencing technologies, and the resolving power of overlapping pool design, TILLING provides an efficient and economical platform for functional genomics across thousands of organisms.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a probabilistic method for calling TILLING-induced mutations, and their carriers, from high throughput sequencing data of overlapping population pools, where each individual occurs in two pools.

To better understand the dynamic regulation of focal adhesions, we have developed an analysis system for the automated detection, tracking, and data extraction of these structures in living cells. This analysis system was used to quantify the dynamics of fluorescently tagged Paxillin and FAK in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts followed via Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRF). High content time series included the size, shape, intensity, and position of every adhesion present in a living cell. These properties were followed over time, revealing adhesion lifetime and turnover rates, and segregation of properties into distinct zones. As a proof-of-concept, we show how a single point mutation in Paxillin at the Jun-kinase phosphorylation site Serine 178 changes FA size, distribution, and rate of assembly. This study provides a detailed, quantitative picture of FA spatiotemporal dynamics as well as a set of tools and methodologies for advancing our understanding of how focal adhesions are dynamically regulated in living cells. A full, open-source software implementation of this pipeline is provided at http://gomezlab.bme.unc.edu/tools.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21789500,NeuroNames: an ontology for the BrainInfo portal to neuroscience on the web.,"BrainInfo (                            http://braininfo.org                                                     ) is a growing portal to neuroscientific information on the Web. It is indexed by NeuroNames, an ontology designed to compensate for ambiguities in neuroanatomical nomenclature. The 20-year old ontology continues to evolve toward the ideal of recognizing all names of neuroanatomical entities and accommodating all structural concepts about which neuroscientists communicate, including multiple concepts of entities for which neuroanatomists have yet to determine the best or 'true' conceptualization. To make the definitions of structural concepts unambiguous and terminologically consistent we created a 'default vocabulary' of unique structure names selected from existing terminology. We selected standard names by criteria designed to maximize practicality for use in verbal communication as well as computerized knowledge management. The ontology of NeuroNames accommodates synonyms and homonyms of the standard terms in many languages. It defines complex structures as models composed of primary structures, which are defined in unambiguous operational terms. NeuroNames currently relates more than 16,000 names in eight languages to some 2,500 neuroanatomical concepts. The ontology is maintained in a relational database with three core tables: Names, Concepts and Models. BrainInfo uses NeuroNames to index information by structure, to interpret users' queries and to clarify terminology on remote web pages. NeuroNames is a resource vocabulary of the NLM's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS, 2011) and the basis for the brain regions component of NIFSTD (NeuroLex, 2011). The current version has been downloaded to hundreds of laboratories for indexing data and linking to BrainInfo, which attracts some 400 visitors/day, downloading 2,000 pages/day.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21791534,A dynamic programming algorithm for identification of triplex-forming sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Current methods for identification of potential triplex-forming sequences in genomes and similar sequence sets rely primarily on detecting homopurine and homopyrimidine tracts. Procedures capable of detecting sequences supporting imperfect, but structurally feasible intramolecular triplex structures are needed for better sequence analysis.<h4>Results</h4>We modified an algorithm for detection of approximate palindromes, so as to account for the special nature of triplex DNA structures. From available literature, we conclude that approximate triplexes tolerate two classes of errors. One, analogical to mismatches in duplex DNA, involves nucleotides in triplets that do not readily form Hoogsteen bonds. The other class involves geometrically incompatible neighboring triplets hindering proper alignment of strands for optimal hydrogen bonding and stacking. We tested the statistical properties of the algorithm, as well as its correctness when confronted with known triplex sequences. The proposed algorithm satisfactorily detects sequences with intramolecular triplex-forming potential. Its complexity is directly comparable to palindrome searching.<h4>Availability</h4>Our implementation of the algorithm is available at http://www.fi.muni.cz/lexa/triplex as source code and a web-based search tool. The source code compiles into a library providing searching capability to other programs, as well as into a stand-alone command-line application based on this library.<h4>Contact</h4>lexa@fi.muni.cz<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21798033,Visualizing meta-features in proteomic maps.,"<h4>Background</h4>The steps of a high-throughput proteomics experiment include the separation, differential expression and mass spectrometry-based identification of proteins. However, the last and more challenging step is inferring the biological role of the identified proteins through their association with interaction networks, biological pathways, analysis of the effect of post-translational modifications, and other protein-related information.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we present an integrative visualization methodology that allows combining experimentally produced proteomic features with protein meta-features, typically coming from meta-analysis tools and databases, in synthetic Proteomic Feature Maps. Using three proteomics analysis scenarios, we show that the proposed visualization approach is effective in filtering, navigating and interacting with the proteomics data in order to address visually challenging biological questions. The novelty of our approach lies in the ease of integration of any user-defined proteomic features in easy-to-comprehend visual representations that resemble the familiar 2D-gel images, and can be adapted to the user's needs. The main capabilities of the developed VIP software, which implements the presented visualization methodology, are also highlighted and discussed.<h4>Conclusions</h4>By using this visualization and the associated VIP software, researchers can explore a complex heterogeneous proteomics dataset from different perspectives in order to address visually important biological queries and formulate new hypotheses for further investigation.

21828087,"OrganismTagger: detection, normalization and grounding of organism entities in biomedical documents.","<h4>Motivation</h4>Semantic tagging of organism mentions in full-text articles is an important part of literature mining and semantic enrichment solutions. Tagged organism mentions also play a pivotal role in disambiguating other entities in a text, such as proteins. A high-precision organism tagging system must be able to detect the numerous forms of organism mentions, including common names as well as the traditional taxonomic groups: genus, species and strains. In addition, such a system must resolve abbreviations and acronyms, assign the scientific name and if possible link the detected mention to the NCBI Taxonomy database for further semantic queries and literature navigation.<h4>Results</h4>We present the OrganismTagger, a hybrid rule-based/machine learning system to extract organism mentions from the literature. It includes tools for automatically generating lexical and ontological resources from a copy of the NCBI Taxonomy database, thereby facilitating system updates by end users. Its novel ontology-based resources can also be reused in other semantic mining and linked data tasks. Each detected organism mention is normalized to a canonical name through the resolution of acronyms and abbreviations and subsequently grounded with an NCBI Taxonomy database ID. In particular, our system combines a novel machine-learning approach with rule-based and lexical methods for detecting strain mentions in documents. On our manually annotated OT corpus, the OrganismTagger achieves a precision of 95%, a recall of 94% and a grounding accuracy of 97.5%. On the manually annotated corpus of Linnaeus-100, the results show a precision of 99%, recall of 97% and grounding accuracy of 97.4%.<h4>Availability</h4>The OrganismTagger, including supporting tools, resources, training data and manual annotations, as well as end user and developer documentation, is freely available under an open-source license at http://www.semanticsoftware.info/organism-tagger.<h4>Contact</h4>witte@semanticsoftware.info.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21846404,Prediction of conformational B-cell epitopes from 3D structures by random forests with a distance-based feature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Antigen-antibody interactions are key events in immune system, which provide important clues to the immune processes and responses. In Antigen-antibody interactions, the specific sites on the antigens that are directly bound by the B-cell produced antibodies are well known as B-cell epitopes. The identification of epitopes is a hot topic in bioinformatics because of their potential use in the epitope-based drug design. Although most B-cell epitopes are discontinuous (or conformational), insufficient effort has been put into the conformational epitope prediction, and the performance of existing methods is far from satisfaction.<h4>Results</h4>In order to develop the high-accuracy model, we focus on some possible aspects concerning the prediction performance, including the impact of interior residues, different contributions of adjacent residues, and the imbalanced data which contain much more non-epitope residues than epitope residues. In order to address above issues, we take following strategies. Firstly, a concept of 'thick surface patch' instead of 'surface patch' is introduced to describe the local spatial context of each surface residue, which considers the impact of interior residue. The comparison between the thick surface patch and the surface patch shows that interior residues contribute to the recognition of epitopes. Secondly, statistical significance of the distance distribution difference between non-epitope patches and epitope patches is observed, thus an adjacent residue distance feature is presented, which reflects the unequal contributions of adjacent residues to the location of binding sites. Thirdly, a bootstrapping and voting procedure is adopted to deal with the imbalanced dataset. Based on the above ideas, we propose a new method to identify the B-cell conformational epitopes from 3D structures by combining conventional features and the proposed feature, and the random forest (RF) algorithm is used as the classification engine. The experiments show that our method can predict conformational B-cell epitopes with high accuracy. Evaluated by leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), our method achieves the mean AUC value of 0.633 for the benchmark bound dataset, and the mean AUC value of 0.654 for the benchmark unbound dataset. When compared with the state-of-the-art prediction models in the independent test, our method demonstrates comparable or better performance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our method is demonstrated to be effective for the prediction of conformational epitopes. Based on the study, we develop a tool to predict the conformational epitopes from 3D structures, available at http://code.google.com/p/my-project-bpredictor/downloads/list.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21873327,Finding recurrent copy number alterations preserving within-sample homogeneity.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Copy number alterations (CNAs) represent an important component of genetic variation and play a significant role in many human diseases. Development of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technology has made it possible to identify CNAs. Identification of recurrent CNAs represents the first fundamental step to provide a list of genomic regions which form the basis for further biological investigations. The main problem in recurrent CNAs discovery is related to the need to distinguish between functional changes and random events without pathological relevance. Within-sample homogeneity represents a common feature of copy number profile in cancer, so it can be used as additional source of information to increase the accuracy of the results. Although several algorithms aimed at the identification of recurrent CNAs have been proposed, no attempt of a comprehensive comparison of different approaches has yet been published.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a new approach, called Genomic Analysis of Important Alterations (GAIA), to find recurrent CNAs where a statistical hypothesis framework is extended to take into account within-sample homogeneity. Statistical significance and within-sample homogeneity are combined into an iterative procedure to extract the regions that likely are involved in functional changes. Results show that GAIA represents a valid alternative to other proposed approaches. In addition, we perform an accurate comparison by using two real aCGH datasets and a carefully planned simulation study.<h4>Availability</h4>GAIA has been implemented as R/Bioconductor package.

21896882,Functional network construction in Arabidopsis using rule-based machine learning on large-scale data sets.,"The meta-analysis of large-scale postgenomics data sets within public databases promises to provide important novel biological knowledge. Statistical approaches including correlation analyses in coexpression studies of gene expression have emerged as tools to elucidate gene function using these data sets. Here, we present a powerful and novel alternative methodology to computationally identify functional relationships between genes from microarray data sets using rule-based machine learning. This approach, termed """"coprediction,"""" is based on the collective ability of groups of genes co-occurring within rules to accurately predict the developmental outcome of a biological system. We demonstrate the utility of coprediction as a powerful analytical tool using publicly available microarray data generated exclusively from Arabidopsis thaliana seeds to compute a functional gene interaction network, termed Seed Co-Prediction Network (SCoPNet). SCoPNet predicts functional associations between genes acting in the same developmental and signal transduction pathways irrespective of the similarity in their respective gene expression patterns. Using SCoPNet, we identified four novel regulators of seed germination (ALTERED SEED GERMINATION5, 6, 7, and 8), and predicted interactions at the level of transcript abundance between these novel and previously described factors influencing Arabidopsis seed germination. An online Web tool to query SCoPNet has been developed as a community resource to dissect seed biology and is available at http://www.vseed.nottingham.ac.uk/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21985277,A model-based circular binary segmentation algorithm for the analysis of array CGH data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) is a permutation-based algorithm for array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) data analysis. CBS accurately segments data by detecting change-points using a maximal-t test; but extensive computational burden is involved for evaluating the significance of change-points using permutations. A recent implementation utilizing a hybrid method and early stopping rules (hybrid CBS) to improve the performance in speed was subsequently proposed. However, a time analysis revealed that a major portion of computation time of the hybrid CBS was still spent on permutation. In addition, what the hybrid method provides is an approximation of the significance upper bound or lower bound, not an approximation of the significance of change-points itself.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a novel model-based algorithm, extreme-value based CBS (eCBS), which limits permutations and provides robust results without loss of accuracy. Thousands of aCGH data under null hypothesis were simulated in advance based on a variety of non-normal assumptions, and the corresponding maximal-t distribution was modeled by the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The modeling results, which associate characteristics of aCGH data to the GEV parameters, constitute lookup tables (eXtreme model). Using the eXtreme model, the significance of change-points could be evaluated in a constant time complexity through a table lookup process.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A novel algorithm, eCBS, was developed in this study. The current implementation of eCBS consistently outperforms the hybrid CBS 4� to 20� in computation time without loss of accuracy.

22014078,"Inputs to quality: supervision, management, and community involvement in health facilities in Egypt in 2004.","<h4>Background</h4>As low- and middle-income countries experience economic development, ensuring quality of health care delivery is a central component of health reform. Nevertheless, health reforms in low- and middle-income countries have focused more on access to services rather than the quality of these services, and reporting on quality has been limited. In the present study, we sought to examine the prevalence and regional variation in key management practices in Egyptian health facilities within three domains: supervision of the facility from the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), managerial processes, and patient and community involvement in care.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 559 facilities surveyed with the Egyptian Service Provision Assessment (ESPA) survey in 2004, the most recent such survey in Egypt. We registered on the Measure Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) website http://legacy.measuredhs.com/login.cfm to gain access to the survey data. From the ESPA sampled 559 MOHP facilities, we excluded a total of 79 facilities because they did not offer facility-based 24-hour care or have at least one physician working in the facility, resulting in a final sample of 480 facilities. The final sample included 76 general service hospitals, 307 rural health units, and 97 maternal and child health and urban health units (MCH/urban units). We used standard frequency analyses to describe facility characteristics and tested the statistical significance of regional differences using chi-square statistics.<h4>Results</h4>Nearly all facilities reported having external supervision within the 6 months preceding the interview. In contrast, key facility-level managerial processes, such as having routine and documented management meetings and applying quality assurance approaches, were uncommon. Involvement of communities and patients was also reported in a minority of facilities. Hospitals and health units located in Urban Egypt compared with more rural parts of Egypt were significantly more likely to have management committees that met at least monthly, to keep official records of the meetings, and to have an approach for reviewing quality assurance activities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although the data precede the recent reform efforts of the MOHP, they provide a baseline against which future progress can be measured. Targeted efforts to improve facility-level management are critical to supporting quality improvement initiatives directed at improving the quality of health care throughout the country.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22014236,An integrated workflow for robust alignment and simplified quantitative analysis of NMR spectrometry data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful technique to reveal and compare quantitative metabolic profiles of biological tissues. However, chemical and physical sample variations make the analysis of the data challenging, and typically require the application of a number of preprocessing steps prior to data interpretation. For example, noise reduction, normalization, baseline correction, peak picking, spectrum alignment and statistical analysis are indispensable components in any NMR analysis pipeline.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a novel suite of informatics tools for the quantitative analysis of NMR metabolomic profile data. The core of the processing cascade is a novel peak alignment algorithm, called hierarchical Cluster-based Peak Alignment (CluPA). The algorithm aligns a target spectrum to the reference spectrum in a top-down fashion by building a hierarchical cluster tree from peak lists of reference and target spectra and then dividing the spectra into smaller segments based on the most distant clusters of the tree. To reduce the computational time to estimate the spectral misalignment, the method makes use of Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) cross-correlation. Since the method returns a high-quality alignment, we can propose a simple methodology to study the variability of the NMR spectra. For each aligned NMR data point the ratio of the between-group and within-group sum of squares (BW-ratio) is calculated to quantify the difference in variability between and within predefined groups of NMR spectra. This differential analysis is related to the calculation of the F-statistic or a one-way ANOVA, but without distributional assumptions. Statistical inference based on the BW-ratio is achieved by bootstrapping the null distribution from the experimental data.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The workflow performance was evaluated using a previously published dataset. Correlation maps, spectral and grey scale plots show clear improvements in comparison to other methods, and the down-to-earth quantitative analysis works well for the CluPA-aligned spectra. The whole workflow is embedded into a modular and statistically sound framework that is implemented as an R package called """"speaq"""" (""""spectrum alignment and quantitation""""), which is freely available from http://code.google.com/p/speaq/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

H. vitripennis is highly polyphagous and voracious, feeding on at least 100 plant species and consuming up to 100 times its weight in xylem fluid daily. The insect is a vector of the phytopathogen Xylella fastidiosa (Wells), which is the causative agent of Pierce's disease in grapevines. To evaluate the microbial flora associated with H. vitripennis, total DNA extracts from hemolymph, alimentary canal excretions, and whole insect bodies were subjected to 16S rDNA pyrosequencing using the bTEFAP methodology and the resulting sequences (370-520 bp in length) were compared with a curated high quality 16S database derived from GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Species from the genera Wolbachia, Delftia (formerly Pseudomonas), Pectobacterium, Moraxella, Serratia, Bacillus, and many others were detected and a comprehensive picture of the microbiome associated with H. vitripennis was established.

However, this approach poses a number of problems, ranging from sharing issues to inefficient data-mining. Standard spreadsheets are also error-prone, as data do not undergo any validation process. To overcome spreadsheets inherent limitations, a number of proprietary systems have been developed, which laboratories need to pay expensive license fees for. Those costs are usually prohibitive for most laboratories and prevent scientists from benefiting from more sophisticated data management systems.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper, we propose the EnzymeTracker, a web-based laboratory information management system for sample tracking, as an open-source and flexible alternative that aims at facilitating entry, mining and sharing of experimental biological data. The EnzymeTracker features online spreadsheets and tools for monitoring numerous experiments conducted by several collaborators to identify and characterize samples. It also provides libraries of shared data such as protocols, and administration tools for data access control using OpenID and user/team management. Our system relies on a database management system for efficient data indexing and management and a user-friendly AJAX interface that can be accessed over the Internet. The EnzymeTracker facilitates data entry by dynamically suggesting entries and providing smart data-mining tools to effectively retrieve data. Our system features a number of tools to visualize and annotate experimental data, and export highly customizable reports. It also supports QR matrix barcoding to facilitate sample tracking.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The EnzymeTracker was designed to be easy to use and offers many benefits over spreadsheets, thus presenting the characteristics required to facilitate acceptance by the scientific community.

22303397,Accurate microRNA Target Prediction Using Detailed Binding Site Accessibility and Machine Learning on Proteomics Data.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small regulatory genes regulating gene expression by targeting messenger RNA. Though computational methods for miRNA target prediction are the prevailing means to analyze their function, they still miss a large fraction of the targeted genes and additionally predict a large number of false positives. Here we introduce a novel algorithm called DIANA-microT-ANN which combines multiple novel target site features through an artificial neural network (ANN) and is trained using recently published high-throughput data measuring the change of protein levels after miRNA overexpression, providing positive and negative targeting examples. The features characterizing each miRNA recognition element include binding structure, conservation level, and a specific profile of structural accessibility. The ANN is trained to integrate the features of each recognition element along the 3'untranslated region into a targeting score, reproducing the relative repression fold change of the protein. Tested on two different sets the algorithm outperforms other widely used algorithms and also predicts a significant number of unique and reliable targets not predicted by the other methods. For 542 human miRNAs DIANA-microT-ANN predicts 120000 targets not provided by TargetScan 5.0. The algorithm is freely available at http://microrna.gr/microT-ANN.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Previous studies, mostly in non-Caucasian populations, suggest that p53 mutations may be involved. To substantiate this, we performed DNA sequence analysis of exons 4-8 of the p53 gene and immunohistochemical staining of p53 protein in archived keloidal tissue samples from 23 Caucasian patients. In contrast to previous reports, we found mutated p53 in keloidal tissue in a minority of cases (2/23; 12%). The G allele frequency and C allele frequency at the p53 polymorphic codon 72 were 0.72 (33/46) and 0.28 (13/46), respectively, in our study, a finding that was similar to the 0.77 (184/240) vs. 0.23 (56/240) (P = 0.4580; chi-squared test) observed in the Hap Map data of a European population but statistically significantly different from the 0.43 (547/1258) vs. 0.57 (711/1258) (P = 0.0002; chi-squared test) observed in the 1000 Genome project [Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP). Bethesda (MD): National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine. dbSNP accession:rs1042522, (dbSNP Build ID: 132). Available from: (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/] a difference most likely due to the different genetic background of the populations enrolled. However, one-third of the keloidal samples showed lesional nuclear p53 staining with a UV penetration gradient-like positivity (P = 0.0084). Staining with an anti-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer antibody revealed the total absence of short-term photoproducts in the epidermis as well as keloidal tissue. Furthermore, all fibroblasts expressing p53 stained negative for Ki-67, indicating that these cells were in a quiescent stage and p53 upregulation did not contribute to keloidal proliferation. We conclude that p53 plays no major role in the pathogenesis of keloids in the Caucasian population.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource

The method utilizes the z-score value of the distance measure in the feature vector space to estimate the relative contribution among the k-nearest neighbors for prediction of the discrete and continuous solvent accessibility. The Solvent accessibility database is constructed from 5717 proteins extracted from PISCES culling server with the cutoff of 25% sequence identities. Using optimal parameters, the prediction accuracies (for discrete predictions) of 78.38% (two-state prediction with the threshold of 25%), 65.1% (three-state prediction with the thresholds of 9 and 36%), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (between the predicted and true RSA's for continuous prediction) of 0.676 are achieved An independent benchmark test was performed with the CASP8 targets where we find that the proposed method outperforms existing methods. The prediction accuracies are 80.89% (for two state prediction with the threshold of 25%), 67.58% (three-state prediction), and the Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.727 (for continuous prediction) with mean absolute error of 0.148.

22435961,Healthcare continuity from hospital to territory in Lombardy: TELEMACO project.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To verify implementation and use of TELEMACO (TELEMedicina Ai piccoli COmunilombardi; http://www.telemaco.regione.lombardia.it/), which provides specialized continuity of care with innovative healthcare services in remote areas of the Lombardy region of Italy; to design a network in the territory for sharing of continuityof- care programs; and to allow the relevant health authorities to collect cost data to establish a model for sustainable pricing for implementing these services.<h4>Methods</h4>TELEMACO provides home-based telemanagement services for patients with chronic heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as second-opinion teleconsultations in cardiology, dermatology, diabetology, and pulmonology for general practitioners and second-opinion teleconsultations on digital images in cases of traumatic brain injury and stroke. A total of 2 service centers, 10 cardiology and pneumology departments, 30 specialists, 176 general practitioners, 40 nurses, 2 emergency departments, and 2 consultant hospitals were involved.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 166 patients with chronic heart failure and 474 patients with COPD were enrolled. There were 4830, 51, and 44 second-opinion teleconsultations for cardiologic, dermatologic, and diabetic conditions, respectively. There were 147 second-opinion teleconsultations on digital images, 68 for stroke, and 79 for traumatic brain injury. Implementation of TELEMACO introduced innovations in working methods and provided evidence to the health authorities for allocating funds for such services.<h4>Conclusions</h4>TELEMACO provided evidence that there is a growing need for home management of patients using telemedicine, a common and efficacious approach that can ensure care continuity, especially in chronic diseases.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22454131,Revealing mammalian evolutionary relationships by comparative analysis of gene clusters.,"Many software tools for comparative analysis of genomic sequence data have been released in recent decades. Despite this, it remains challenging to determine evolutionary relationships in gene clusters due to their complex histories involving duplications, deletions, inversions, and conversions. One concept describing these relationships is orthology. Orthologs derive from a common ancestor by speciation, in contrast to paralogs, which derive from duplication. Discriminating orthologs from paralogs is a necessary step in most multispecies sequence analyses, but doing so accurately is impeded by the occurrence of gene conversion events. We propose a refined method of orthology assignment based on two paradigms for interpreting its definition: by genomic context or by sequence content. X-orthology (based on context) traces orthology resulting from speciation and duplication only, while N-orthology (based on content) includes the influence of conversion events. We developed a computational method for automatically mapping both types of orthology on a per-nucleotide basis in gene cluster regions studied by comparative sequencing, and we make this mapping accessible by visualizing the output. All of these steps are incorporated into our newly extended CHAP 2 package. We evaluate our method using both simulated data and real gene clusters (including the well-characterized a-globin and �-globin clusters). We also illustrate use of CHAP 2 by analyzing four more loci: CCL (chemokine ligand), IFN (interferon), CYP2abf (part of cytochrome P450 family 2), and KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors). These new methods facilitate and extend our understanding of evolution at these and other loci by adding automated accurate evolutionary inference to the biologist's toolkit.

22479706,Network-based functional enrichment.,"<h4>Background</h4>Many methods have been developed to infer and reason about molecular interaction networks. These approaches often yield networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes and up to an order of magnitude more edges. It is often desirable to summarize the biological information in such networks. A very common approach is to use gene function enrichment analysis for this task. A major drawback of this method is that it ignores information about the edges in the network being analyzed, i.e., it treats the network simply as a set of genes. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for functional enrichment that explicitly takes network interactions into account.<h4>Results</h4>Our approach naturally generalizes Fisher's exact test, a gene set-based technique. Given a function of interest, we compute the subgraph of the network induced by genes annotated to this function. We use the sequence of sizes of the connected components of this sub-network to estimate its connectivity. We estimate the statistical significance of the connectivity empirically by a permutation test. We present three applications of our method: i) determine which functions are enriched in a given network, ii) given a network and an interesting subnetwork of genes within that network, determine which functions are enriched in the sub-network, and iii) given two networks, determine the functions for which the connectivity improves when we merge the second network into the first. Through these applications, we show that our approach is a natural alternative to network clustering algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We presented a novel approach to functional enrichment that takes into account the pairwise relationships among genes annotated by a particular function. Each of the three applications discovers highly relevant functions. We used our methods to study biological data from three different organisms. Our results demonstrate the wide applicability of our methods. Our algorithms are implemented in C++ and are freely available under the GNU General Public License at our supplementary website.

This technical concern introduces biases that hamper any synthetic studies or comparison of genetic diversity between collections. To prevent this for Sorghum bicolor, we developed a control kit of 48 SSR markers.<h4>Methods and results</h4>One hundred seventeen markers were selected along the genome to provide coverage across the length of all 10 sorghum linkage groups. They were tested for polymorphism and reproducibility across two laboratories (Centre de Cooperation Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement [CIRAD], France, and International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics [ICRISAT], India) using two commonly used genotyping technologies (polyacrylamide gel-based technology with LI-COR sequencing machines and capillary systems with ABI sequencing apparatus) with DNA samples from a diverse set of 48 S. bicolor accessions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A kit for diversity analysis (http://sat.cirad.fr/sat/sorghum_SSR_kit/) was developed. It contains information on 48 technically robust sorghum microsatellite markers and 10 DNA controls. It can further be used to calibrate sorghum SSR genotyping data acquired with different technologies and compare those to genetic diversity references.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22645320,Integrative analysis of gene and miRNA expression profiles with transcription factor-miRNA feed-forward loops identifies regulators in human cancers.,"We describe here a novel method for integrating gene and miRNA expression profiles in cancer using feed-forward loops (FFLs) consisting of transcription factors (TFs), miRNAs and their common target genes. The dChip-GemiNI (Gene and miRNA Network-based Integration) method statistically ranks computationally predicted FFLs by their explanatory power to account for differential gene and miRNA expression between two biological conditions such as normal and cancer. GemiNI integrates not only gene and miRNA expression data but also computationally derived information about TF-target gene and miRNA-mRNA interactions. Literature validation shows that the integrated modeling of expression data and FFLs better identifies cancer-related TFs and miRNAs compared to existing approaches. We have utilized GemiNI for analyzing six data sets of solid cancers (liver, kidney, prostate, lung and germ cell) and found that top-ranked FFLs account for ~20% of transcriptome changes between normal and cancer. We have identified common FFL regulators across multiple cancer types, such as known FFLs consisting of MYC and miR-15/miR-17 families, and novel FFLs consisting of ARNT, CREB1 and their miRNA partners.

22659403,Determining pair distance distribution function from SAXS data using parametric functionals.,"Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments are widely applied in structural biology. The SAXS experiments yield one-dimensional profile that needs further analysis to reveal structural information. The pair distance distribution function (PDDF), P(r), can provide molecular structures more intuitively, and it can be used to guide ab initio model reconstructions, making it a critical step to derive P(r) from experimental SAXS profiles. To calculate the P(r) curves, a new method based on a specially designed parametric functional form is developed, and implemented in pregxs. This method is tested against both synthetic and experimental data, the estimated P(r) functions are in good agreement with correct or known P(r). The method can also predict the molecular size. In summary, the pregxs method is robust and accurate in P(r) determination from SAXS profiles.

22672126,"Trends in midwife-attended births in the United States, 1989-2009.","<h4>Introduction</h4>Data on attendance at birth by midwives in the United States have been available on the national level since 1989. Rates of certified nurse-midwife (CNM)-attended births more than doubled between 1989 (3.3% of all births) and 2002 (7.7%) and have remained steady since. This article examines trends in midwife-attended births from 1989 to 2009.<h4>Methods</h4>The data in this report are based on records gathered as part of the US National Standard Certificate of Live Birth from a public use Web site, Vital Stats (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/VitalStats.htm), that allows users to create and download specialized tables.<h4>Results</h4>Between 2007 and 2009, the proportion of all births attended by CNMs increased by 4% from 7.3% of all births to 7.6% and a total of 313,516. This represents a decline in total births attended by CNMs from 2008 but a higher proportion of all births because total US births dropped at a faster rate. The proportion of vaginal births attended by CNMs reached an all-time high of 11.4% in 2009. There were strong regional patterns to the distribution of CNM-attended births. Births attended by """"other midwives"""" rose to 21,787 or 0.5% of all US births, and the total proportion of all births attended by midwives reached an all-time high of 8.1%. The race/ethnicity of mothers attended by CNMs has shifted over the years. In 1990, CNMs attended a disproportionately high number of births to non-white mothers, whereas in 2009, the profile of CNM births mirrors the national distribution in race/ethnicity.<h4>Discussion</h4>Midwife-attended births in the United States are increasing. The geographic patterns in the distribution of midwife-attended births warrant further study.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22672254,The gastrointestinal electrical mapping suite (GEMS): software for analyzing and visualizing high-resolution (multi-electrode) recordings in spatiotemporal detail.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gastrointestinal contractions are controlled by an underlying bioelectrical activity. High-resolution spatiotemporal electrical mapping has become an important advance for investigating gastrointestinal electrical behaviors in health and motility disorders. However, research progress has been constrained by the low efficiency of the data analysis tasks. This work introduces a new efficient software package: GEMS (Gastrointestinal Electrical Mapping Suite), for analyzing and visualizing high-resolution multi-electrode gastrointestinal mapping data in spatiotemporal detail.<h4>Results</h4>GEMS incorporates a number of new and previously validated automated analytical and visualization methods into a coherent framework coupled to an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface. GEMS is implemented using MATLAB�, which combines sophisticated mathematical operations and GUI compatibility. Recorded slow wave data can be filtered via a range of inbuilt techniques, efficiently analyzed via automated event-detection and cycle clustering algorithms, and high quality isochronal activation maps, velocity field maps, amplitude maps, frequency (time interval) maps and data animations can be rapidly generated. Normal and dysrhythmic activities can be analyzed, including initiation and conduction abnormalities. The software is distributed free to academics via a community user website and forum (http://sites.google.com/site/gimappingsuite).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This software allows for the rapid analysis and generation of critical results from gastrointestinal high-resolution electrical mapping data, including quantitative analysis and graphical outputs for qualitative analysis. The software is designed to be used by non-experts in data and signal processing, and is intended to be used by clinical researchers as well as physiologists and bioengineers. The use and distribution of this software package will greatly accelerate efforts to improve the understanding of the causes and clinical consequences of gastrointestinal electrical disorders, through high-resolution electrical mapping.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22689643,MoNetFamily: a web server to infer homologous modules and module-module interaction networks in vertebrates.,"A module is a fundamental unit forming with highly connected proteins and performs a certain kind of biological functions. Modules and module-module interaction (MMI) network are essential for understanding cellular processes and functions. The MoNetFamily web server can identify the modules, homologous modules (called module family) and MMI networks across multiple species for the query protein(s). This server first finds module candidates of the query by using BLASTP to search the module template database (1785 experimental and 1252 structural templates). MoNetFamily then infers the homologous modules of the selected module candidate using protein-protein interaction (PPI) families. According to homologous modules and PPIs, we statistically calculated MMIs and MMI networks across multiple species. For each module candidate, MoNetFamily identifies its neighboring modules and their MMIs in module networks of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and Danio rerio. Finally, MoNetFamily shows the conserved proteins, PPI profiles and functional annotations of the module family. Our results indicate that the server can be useful for MMI network (e.g. 1818 modules and 9678 MMIs in H. sapiens) visualizations and query annotations using module families and neighboring modules. We believe that the server is able to provide valuable insights to determine homologous modules and MMI networks across multiple species for studying module evolution and cellular processes.

Given these limitations, development of a method that can bin vast amounts of metagenomic sequence data in a rapid, efficient and computationally inexpensive manner can profoundly influence metagenomic analysis in computational resource poor settings. We introduce TWARIT, a hybrid binning algorithm, that employs a combination of short-read alignment and composition-based signature sorting approaches to achieve rapid binning rates without compromising on binning accuracy and specificity. TWARIT is validated with simulated and real-world metagenomes and the results demonstrate significantly lower overall binning times compared to that of existing methods. Furthermore, the binning accuracy and specificity of TWARIT are observed to be comparable/superior to them.

In this work, we propose a new framework for the detection of fusion transcripts through short paired-end reads which integrates splicing-driven alignment and abundance estimation analysis, producing a more accurate set of reads supporting the junction discovery and taking into account also not annotated transcripts. Bellerophontes performs a selection of putative junctions on the basis of a match to an accurate gene fusion model.<h4>Results</h4>We report the fusion genes discovered by the proposed framework on experimentally validated biological samples of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and on public NCBI datasets, for which Bellerophontes is able to detect the exact junction sequence. With respect to state-of-art approaches, Bellerophontes detects the same experimentally validated fusions, however, it is more selective on the total number of detected fusions and provides a more accurate set of spanning reads supporting the junctions. We finally report the fusions involving non-annotated transcripts found in CML samples.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Bellerophontes JAVA/Perl/Bash software implementation is free and available at http://eda.polito.it/bellerophontes/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Structural genomic projects are beginning to produce protein structures with unknown functions. Therefore, efficient methods are required if all these structures are to be properly annotated. Lots of methods for finding binding sites involve 3D structure comparison. Here we design a method to find protein binding sites by direct comparison of protein 3D structures.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed an efficient heuristic approach for finding similar binding sites from the surface of given proteins. Our approach consists of three steps: local sequence alignment, protein surface detection, and 3D structures comparison. We implement the algorithm and produce a software package that works well in practice. When comparing a complete protein with all complete protein structures in the PDB database, experiments show that the average recall value of our approach is 82% and the average precision value of our approach is also significantly better than the existing approaches.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our program has much higher recall values than those existing programs. Experiments show that all the existing approaches have recall values less than 50%. This implies that more than 50% of real binding sites cannot be reported by those existing approaches.

22780965,ngLOC: software and web server for predicting protein subcellular localization in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Understanding protein subcellular localization is a necessary component toward understanding the overall function of a protein. Numerous computational methods have been published over the past decade, with varying degrees of success. Despite the large number of published methods in this area, only a small fraction of them are available for researchers to use in their own studies. Of those that are available, many are limited by predicting only a small number of organelles in the cell. Additionally, the majority of methods predict only a single location for a sequence, even though it is known that a large fraction of the proteins in eukaryotic species shuttle between locations to carry out their function.<h4>Findings</h4>We present a software package and a web server for predicting the subcellular localization of protein sequences based on the ngLOC method. ngLOC is an n-gram-based Bayesian classifier that predicts subcellular localization of proteins both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The overall prediction accuracy varies from 89.8% to 91.4% across species. This program can predict 11 distinct locations each in plant and animal species. ngLOC also predicts 4 and 5 distinct locations on gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial datasets, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ngLOC is a generic method that can be trained by data from a variety of species or classes for predicting protein subcellular localization.

22796958,A regression model for estimating DNA copy number applied to capture sequencing data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Target enrichment, also referred to as DNA capture, provides an effective way to focus sequencing efforts on a genomic region of interest. Capture data are typically used to detect single-nucleotide variants. It can also be used to detect copy number alterations, which is particularly useful in the context of cancer, where such changes occur frequently. In copy number analysis, it is a common practice to determine log-ratios between test and control samples, but this approach results in a loss of information as it disregards the total coverage or intensity at a locus.<h4>Results</h4>We modeled the coverage or intensity of the test sample as a linear function of the control sample. This regression approach is able to deal with regions that are completely deleted, which are problematic for methods that use log-ratios. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we used capture data to determine copy number for a set of 600 genes in a panel of nine breast cancer cell lines. We found high concordance between our results and those generated using a single-nucleotide polymorphsim genotyping platform. When we compared our results with other log-ratio-based methods, including ExomeCNV, we found that our approach produced better overall correlation with SNP data.<h4>Availability</h4>The algorithm is implemented in C and R and the code can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.nki.nl/ocs/<h4>Contact</h4>l.wessels@nki.nl<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

22847931,Deep architectures for protein contact map prediction.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Residue-residue contact prediction is important for protein structure prediction and other applications. However, the accuracy of current contact predictors often barely exceeds 20% on long-range contacts, falling short of the level required for ab initio structure prediction.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we develop a novel machine learning approach for contact map prediction using three steps of increasing resolution. First, we use 2D recursive neural networks to predict coarse contacts and orientations between secondary structure elements. Second, we use an energy-based method to align secondary structure elements and predict contact probabilities between residues in contacting alpha-helices or strands. Third, we use a deep neural network architecture to organize and progressively refine the prediction of contacts, integrating information over both space and time. We train the architecture on a large set of non-redundant proteins and test it on a large set of non-homologous domains, as well as on the set of protein domains used for contact prediction in the two most recent CASP8 and CASP9 experiments. For long-range contacts, the accuracy of the new CMAPpro predictor is close to 30%, a significant increase over existing approaches.<h4>Availability</h4>CMAPpro is available as part of the SCRATCH suite at http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/.<h4>Contact</h4>pfbaldi@uci.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
22848493,"qPMS7: a fast algorithm for finding (ℓ, d)-motifs in DNA and protein sequences.","Detection of rare events happening in a set of DNA/protein sequences could lead to new biological discoveries. One kind of such rare events is the presence of patterns called motifs in DNA/protein sequences. Finding motifs is a challenging problem since the general version of motif search has been proven to be intractable. Motifs discovery is an important problem in biology. For example, it is useful in the detection of transcription factor binding sites and transcriptional regulatory elements that are very crucial in understanding gene function, human disease, drug design, etc. Many versions of the motif search problem have been proposed in the literature. One such is the (l, d)-motif search (or Planted Motif Search (PMS)). A generalized version of the PMS problem, namely, Quorum Planted Motif Search (qPMS), is shown to accurately model motifs in real data. However, solving the qPMS problem is an extremely difficult task because a special case of it, the PMS Problem, is already NP-hard, which means that any algorithm solving it can be expected to take exponential time in the worse case scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named qPMS7 that tackles the qPMS problem on real data as well as challenging instances. Experimental results show that our Algorithm qPMS7 is on an average 5 times faster than the state-of-art algorithm.

22859915,Assessing drug target association using semantic linked data.,"The rapidly increasing amount of public data in chemistry and biology provides new opportunities for large-scale data mining for drug discovery. Systematic integration of these heterogeneous sets and provision of algorithms to data mine the integrated sets would permit investigation of complex mechanisms of action of drugs. In this work we integrated and annotated data from public datasets relating to drugs, chemical compounds, protein targets, diseases, side effects and pathways, building a semantic linked network consisting of over 290,000 nodes and 720,000 edges. We developed a statistical model to assess the association of drug target pairs based on their relation with other linked objects. Validation experiments demonstrate the model can correctly identify known direct drug target pairs with high precision. Indirect drug target pairs (for example drugs which change gene expression level) are also identified but not as strongly as direct pairs. We further calculated the association scores for 157 drugs from 10 disease areas against 1683 human targets, and measured their similarity using a [Formula: see text] score matrix. The similarity network indicates that drugs from the same disease area tend to cluster together in ways that are not captured by structural similarity, with several potential new drug pairings being identified. This work thus provides a novel, validated alternative to existing drug target prediction algorithms.

22861649,A re-evaluation of 9-HODE activity at TRPV1 channels in comparison with anandamide: enantioselectivity and effects at other TRP channels and in sensory neurons.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Two oxidation products of linoleic acid, 9- and 13-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs), have recently been suggested to act as endovanilloids, that is, endogenous agonists of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels, thereby contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia in rats. However, HODE activity at rat TRPV1 in comparison with the best established endovanilloid, anandamide, and its enantioselectivity and selectivity towards other TRP channels that are also abundant in sensory neurons have never been investigated.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>We studied the effect of 9(R)-HODE, 9(S)-HODE, (+/-)13-HODE, 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide and anandamide on [Ca(2+) ](i)  in HEK-293 cells stably expressing the rat or human recombinant TRPV1, or rat recombinant TRPV2, TRPA1 or TRPM8, and also the effect of 9(S)-HODE in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons by calcium imaging.<h4>Key results</h4>Anandamide and 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide were the most potent endovanilloids at human TRPV1, whereas 9(S)-HODE was approximately threefold less efficacious and 75- and 3-fold less potent, respectively, and did not perform much better at rat TRPV1. The 9(R)-HODE and (+/-)13-HODE were almost inactive at TRPV1. Unlike anandamide and 15(S)-hydroxyanandamide, all HODEs were very weak at desensitizing TRPV1 to the action of capsaicin, but activated rat TRPV2 [only (+/-)13-HODE] and rat TRPA1, and antagonized rat TRPM8, at concentrations higher than those required to activate TRPV1. Finally, 9(S)-HODE elevated [Ca(2+) ](i)  in DRG neurons almost exclusively in capsaicin-sensitive cells but only at concentrations between 25 and 100 �M.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>The present data suggest that HODEs are less important endovanilloids than anandamide.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Cannabinoids.

22954625,Performance reproducibility index for classification.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>A common practice in biomarker discovery is to decide whether a large laboratory experiment should be carried out based on the results of a preliminary study on a small set of specimens. Consideration of the efficacy of this approach motivates the introduction of a probabilistic measure, for whether a classifier showing promising results in a small-sample preliminary study will perform similarly on a large independent sample. Given the error estimate from the preliminary study, if the probability of reproducible error is low, then there is really no purpose in substantially allocating more resources to a large follow-on study. Indeed, if the probability of the preliminary study providing likely reproducible results is small, then why even perform the preliminary study?<h4>Results</h4>This article introduces a reproducibility index for classification, measuring the probability that a sufficiently small error estimate on a small sample will motivate a large follow-on study. We provide a simulation study based on synthetic distribution models that possess known intrinsic classification difficulties and emulate real-world scenarios. We also set up similar simulations on four real datasets to show the consistency of results. The reproducibility indices for different distributional models, real datasets and classification schemes are empirically calculated. The effects of reporting and multiple-rule biases on the reproducibility index are also analyzed.<h4>Availability</h4>We have implemented in C code the synthetic data distribution model, classification rules, feature selection routine and error estimation methods.

22962342,GREVE: Genomic Recurrent Event ViEwer to assist the identification of patterns across individual cancer samples.,"<h4>Summary</h4>GREVE has been developed to assist with the identification of recurrent genomic aberrations across cancer samples. The exact characterization of such aberrations remains a challenge despite the availability of increasing amount of data, from SNParray to next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, genomic aberrations in cancer are especially difficult to handle because they are, by nature, unique to the patients. However, their recurrence in specific regions of the genome has been shown to reflect their relevance in the development of tumors. GREVE makes use of previously characterized events to identify such regions and focus any further analysis.<h4>Availability</h4>GREVE is available through a web interface and open-source application (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/GREVE).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23028969,Transcriptome tomography for brain analysis in the web-accessible anatomical space.,"Increased information on the encoded mammalian genome is expected to facilitate an integrated understanding of complex anatomical structure and function based on the knowledge of gene products. Determination of gene expression-anatomy associations is crucial for this understanding. To elicit the association in the three-dimensional (3D) space, we introduce a novel technique for comprehensive mapping of endogenous gene expression into a web-accessible standard space: Transcriptome Tomography. The technique is based on conjugation of sequential tissue-block sectioning, all fractions of which are used for molecular measurements of gene expression densities, and the block- face imaging, which are used for 3D reconstruction of the fractions. To generate a 3D map, tissues are serially sectioned in each of three orthogonal planes and the expression density data are mapped using a tomographic technique. This rapid and unbiased mapping technique using a relatively small number of original data points allows researchers to create their own expression maps in the broad anatomical context of the space. In the first instance we generated a dataset of 36,000 maps, reconstructed from data of 61 fractions measured with microarray, covering the whole mouse brain (ViBrism: http://vibrism.riken.jp/3dviewer/ex/index.html) in one month. After computational estimation of the mapping accuracy we validated the dataset against existing data with respect to the expression location and density. To demonstrate the relevance of the framework, we showed disease related expression of Huntington's disease gene and Bdnf. Our tomographic approach is applicable to analysis of any biological molecules derived from frozen tissues, organs and whole embryos, and the maps are spatially isotropic and well suited to the analysis in the standard space (e.g. Waxholm Space for brain-atlas databases). This will facilitate research creating and using open-standards for a molecular-based understanding of complex structures; and will contribute to new insights into a broad range of biological and medical questions.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23088694,Timing is everything: when to consult palliative care.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Consults promote additional perspectives and help with complex patient management. As the population ages and healthcare demands increase, providers are consulting palliative care (PC). Nurse practitioners (NPs) should understand when to consult PC.<h4>Data sources</h4>Information was obtained from an extensive search of the scientific literature to include Pallimed (http://www.pallimed.org/) and the author's clinical experience.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on the 2009 Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality PC developed from the Hospice and PC Coalition, PC should be consulted at diagnosis. These findings have also been validated in a landmark randomized controlled trial by Temel et al. (2010). The goals of PC are to alleviate suffering and promote quality of life for people with illnesses. PC accepts and incorporates hospice philosophies, but is distinct.<h4>Implications for practice</h4>Many professional organizations are incorporating PC into their specialties and guidelines. In addition to incorporating PC at diagnosis, PC access needs to be improved. New and experienced NPs may appreciate collaborating with PC specialists. Such conversations and relationships will likely offer practical and supportive guidance to both patients and NPs. Overall, the future for PC is promising.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,clinical
23118487,CellLineNavigator: a workbench for cancer cell line analysis.,"The CellLineNavigator database, freely available at http://www.medicalgenomics.org/celllinenavigator, is a web-based workbench for large scale comparisons of a large collection of diverse cell lines. It aims to support experimental design in the fields of genomics, systems biology and translational biomedical research. Currently, this compendium holds genome wide expression profiles of 317 different cancer cell lines, categorized into 57 different pathological states and 28 individual tissues. To enlarge the scope of CellLineNavigator, the database was furthermore closely linked to commonly used bioinformatics databases and knowledge repositories. To ensure easy data access and search ability, a simple data and an intuitive querying interface were implemented. It allows the user to explore and filter gene expression, focusing on pathological or physiological conditions. For a more complex search, the advanced query interface may be used to query for (i) differentially expressed genes; (ii) pathological or physiological conditions; or (iii) gene names or functional attributes, such as Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway maps. These queries may also be combined. Finally, CellLineNavigator allows additional advanced analysis of differentially regulated genes by a direct link to the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) Bioinformatics Resources.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23140436,A possible strategy against head and neck cancer: in silico investigation of three-in-one inhibitors.,"Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Her2, and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) occurs in a variety of malignant tumor tissues. UROD has potential to modulate tumor response of radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, and EGFR and Her2 are common drug targets for the treatment of head and neck cancer. This study attempts to find a possible lead compound backbone from TCM Database@Taiwan ( http://tcm.cmu.edu.tw/ ) for EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins against head and neck cancer using computational techniques. Possible traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) lead compounds had potential binding affinities with EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins. The candidates formed stable interactions with residues Arg803, Thr854 in EGFR, residues Thr862, Asp863 in Her2 protein, and residues Arg37, Arg41 in UROD protein, which are key residues in the binding or catalytic domain of EGFR, Her2, and UROD proteins. Thus, the TCM candidates indicated a possible molecule backbone for evolving potential inhibitors for three drug target proteins against head and neck cancer.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23153250,"MTMDAT-HADDOCK: high-throughput, protein complex structure modeling based on limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry.","<h4>Background</h4>MTMDAT is a program designed to facilitate analysis of mass spectrometry data of proteins and biomolecular complexes that are probed structurally by limited proteolysis. This approach can provide information about stable fragments of multidomain proteins, yield tertiary and quaternary structure data, and help determine the origin of stability changes at the amino acid residue level. Here, we introduce a pipeline between MTMDAT and HADDOCK, that facilitates protein-protein complex structure probing in a high-throughput and highly automated fashion.<h4>Results</h4>A new feature of MTMDAT allows for the direct identification of residues that are involved in complex formation by comparing the mass spectra of bound and unbound proteins after proteolysis. If 3D structures of the unbound components are available, this data can be used to define restraints for data-driven docking to calculate a model of the complex. We describe here a new implementation of MTMDAT, which includes a pipeline to the data-driven docking program HADDOCK, thus streamlining the entire procedure. This addition, together with usability improvements in MTMDAT, enables high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data. The algorithm has been validated by using the protein-protein interaction between the ubiquitin-binding domain of proteasome component Rpn13 and ubiquitin. The resulting structural model, based on restraints extracted by MTMDAT from limited proteolysis and modeled by HADDOCK, was compared to the published NMR structure, which relied on twelve unambiguous intermolecular NOE interactions. The MTMDAT-HADDOCK structure was of similar quality to structures generated using only chemical shift perturbation data derived by NMR titration experiments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new MTMDAT-HADDOCK pipeline enables direct high-throughput modeling of protein complexes from mass spectrometry data. MTMDAT-HADDOCK can be downloaded from http://www.ifm.liu.se/chemistry/molbiotech/maria_sunnerhagens_group/mtmdat/together with the manual and example files.

23181585,A Monte Carlo-based framework enhances the discovery and interpretation of regulatory sequence motifs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Discovery of functionally significant short, statistically overrepresented subsequence patterns (motifs) in a set of sequences is a challenging problem in bioinformatics. Oftentimes, not all sequences in the set contain a motif. These non-motif-containing sequences complicate the algorithmic discovery of motifs. Filtering the non-motif-containing sequences from the larger set of sequences while simultaneously determining the identity of the motif is, therefore, desirable and a non-trivial problem in motif discovery research.<h4>Results</h4>We describe MotifCatcher, a framework that extends the sensitivity of existing motif-finding tools by employing random sampling to effectively remove non-motif-containing sequences from the motif search. We developed two implementations of our algorithm; each built around a commonly used motif-finding tool, and applied our algorithm to three diverse chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data sets. In each case, the motif finder with the MotifCatcher extension demonstrated improved sensitivity over the motif finder alone. Our approach organizes candidate functionally significant discovered motifs into a tree, which allowed us to make additional insights. In all cases, we were able to support our findings with experimental work from the literature.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our framework demonstrates that additional processing at the sequence entry level can significantly improve the performance of existing motif-finding tools. For each biological data set tested, we were able to propose novel biological hypotheses supported by experimental work from the literature. Specifically, in Escherichia coli, we suggested binding site motifs for 6 non-traditional LexA protein binding sites; in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we hypothesize 2 disparate mechanisms for novel binding sites of the Cse4p protein; and in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, we discoverd subtle differences in a general transcription factor (GTF) binding site motif across several data sets. We suggest that small differences in our discovered motif could confer specificity for one or more homologous GTF proteins.

23217202,Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) for generating atomic style objects for molecular modeling.,"<h4>Background</h4>With the progress of nanotechnology, one frequently has to model biological macromolecules simultaneously with nano-objects. However, the atomic structures of the nano objects are typically not available or they are solid state entities. Because of that, the researchers have to investigate such nano systems by generating models of the nano objects in a manner that the existing software be able to carry the simulations. In addition, it should allow generating composite objects with complex shape by combining basic geometrical figures and embedding biological macromolecules within the system.<h4>Results</h4>Here we report the Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) which allows for generating atomic-style geometrical objects with user desired shape and dimensions. Unlimited number of objects can be created and combined with biological macromolecules in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format file. Once the objects are generated, the users can use sliders to manipulate their shape, dimension and absolute position. In addition, the software offers the option to charge the objects with either specified surface or volumetric charge density and to model them with user-desired dielectric constants. According to the user preference, the biological macromolecule atoms can be assigned charges and radii according to four different force fields: Amber, Charmm, OPLS and PARSE. The biological macromolecules and the atomic-style objects are exported as a position, charge and radius (PQR) file, or if a default dielectric constant distribution is not selected, it is exported as a position, charge, radius and epsilon (PQRE) file. As illustration of the capabilities of the ProNOI, we created a composite object in a shape of a robot, aptly named the Clemson Robot, whose parts are charged with various volumetric charge densities and holds the barnase-barstar protein complex in its hand.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) is a convenient tool for generating atomic-style nano shapes in conjunction with biological macromolecule(s). Charges and radii on the macromolecule atoms and the atoms in the shapes are assigned according to the user's preferences allowing various scenarios of modeling.

23281802,BM-Map: an efficient software package for accurately allocating multireads of RNA-sequencing data.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a major tool for biomedical research. A key step in analyzing RNA-seq data is to infer the origin of short reads in the source genome, and for this purpose, many read alignment/mapping software programs have been developed. Usually, the majority of mappable reads can be mapped to one unambiguous genomic location, and these reads are called unique reads. However, a considerable proportion of mappable reads can be aligned to more than one genomic location with the same or similar fidelities, and they are called """"multireads"""". Allocating these multireads is challenging but critical for interpreting RNA-seq data. We recently developed a Bayesian stochastic model that allocates multireads more accurately than alternative methods (Ji et al. Biometrics 2011).<h4>Results</h4>In order to serve a greater biological community, we have implemented this method in a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package, BM-Map. BM-Map takes SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map), the most popular read alignment format, as the standard input; then based on the Bayesian model, it calculates mapping probabilities of multireads for competing genomic loci; and BM-Map generates the output by adding mapping probabilities to the original SAM file so that users can easily perform downstream analyses. The program is available in three common operating systems, Linux, Mac and PC. Moreover, we have built a dedicated website, http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/BM-Map, which includes free downloads, detailed tutorials and illustration examples.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have developed a stand-alone, efficient, and user-friendly software package for accurately allocating multireads, which is an important addition to our previous methodology paper. We believe that this bioinformatics tool will greatly help RNA-seq and related applications reach their full potential in life science research.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23303509,ALE: a generic assembly likelihood evaluation framework for assessing the accuracy of genome and metagenome assemblies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Researchers need general purpose methods for objectively evaluating the accuracy of single and metagenome assemblies and for automatically detecting any errors they may contain. Current methods do not fully meet this need because they require a reference, only consider one of the many aspects of assembly quality or lack statistical justification, and none are designed to evaluate metagenome assemblies.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we present an Assembly Likelihood Evaluation (ALE) framework that overcomes these limitations, systematically evaluating the accuracy of an assembly in a reference-independent manner using rigorous statistical methods. This framework is comprehensive, and integrates read quality, mate pair orientation and insert length (for paired-end reads), sequencing coverage, read alignment and k-mer frequency. ALE pinpoints synthetic errors in both single and metagenomic assemblies, including single-base errors, insertions/deletions, genome rearrangements and chimeric assemblies presented in metagenomes. At the genome level with real-world data, ALE identifies three large misassemblies from the Spirochaeta smaragdinae finished genome, which were all independently validated by Pacific Biosciences sequencing. At the single-base level with Illumina data, ALE recovers 215 of 222 (97%) single nucleotide variants in a training set from a GC-rich Rhodobacter sphaeroides genome. Using real Pacific Biosciences data, ALE identifies 12 of 12 synthetic errors in a Lambda Phage genome, surpassing even Pacific Biosciences' own variant caller, EviCons. In summary, the ALE framework provides a comprehensive, reference-independent and statistically rigorous measure of single genome and metagenome assembly accuracy, which can be used to identify misassemblies or to optimize the assembly process.<h4>Availability</h4>ALE is released as open source software under the UoI/NCSA license at http://www.alescore.org.

The World Wide Web (WWW) has evolved, as a technology, to become more interactive and person centric, tailoring itself to the individual needs of the user. This changing technology may open new avenues to foster mentoring in medicine. DESIGN, SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A search of the MEDLINE database from 1950 to 2012 using the PubMed interface, combined with manual cross-referencing was performed using the following strategy: (""""mentors""""[MeSH Terms] OR """"mentors""""[All Fields] OR """"mentor""""[All Fields]) AND (""""internet""""[MeSH Terms] OR """"internet""""[All Fields]) AND (""""medicine""""[MeSH Terms] OR """"medicine""""[All Fields]) AND (""""humans""""[MeSH Terms] AND English[lang]).

Our study applied high-throughput screening methods to identify causative epigenetic targets in a cohort of men with ABC-associated OSCC. We identified BEX1 and LDOC1 as two epigenetically silenced X-linked tumour suppressors and demonstrated a functional link between the transcription of BEX1 and LDOC1 and promoter hypermethylation. Methylation of the BEX1 and LDOC1 promoters was associated significantly (p < 0.0001) with OSCC and were detected in 75% (42/56) and 89% (50/56) of the samples, respectively. We observed concordant increases in the methylation of both genes in 71% (40/56) of the tumours, and potent in vitro and in vivo growth inhibitory effects in OSCC cells ectopically expressing BEX1 and/or LDOC1. Restored expression of BEX1 and LDOC1 suppressed the nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B (NF-<U+03BA>B) signalling pathway, which is the most frequently hyperactivated signalling pathway in OSCC. This suppression might result from decreased p50 and p65 expression. These findings suggest that silencing of BEX1 and LDOC1 by promoter hypermethylation might represent a critical event in the molecular pathogenesis of OSCC and account for the oncogenic effects of ABC exposure and the male predominance of OSCC occurrence.

ZNF217 is a candidate oncogene located at 20q13, a chromosomal region frequently amplified in breast and ovarian cancer, and correlated with shorter patient survival in these cancers. To properly address the difficulties in managing complex gene interactions given our limited sample, statistical significance of edge strengths was evaluated using bootstrapping and the less reliable edges were pruned to increase the network robustness. We found that 13 out of the 35 genes associated with deregulated ZNF217 expression in breast tumours have been previously associated with survival and/or prognosis in cancers. Identifying genes involved in lipid metabolism opens new fields of investigation to decipher the molecular mechanisms driven by the ZNF217 oncogene. Moreover, nine of the 13 genes have already been identified as putative ZNF217 targets by independent biological studies. We therefore suggest that the algorithms for inferring local BNs are valuable data mining tools for unraveling complex mechanisms of biological pathways from expression data.

23377977,Discovery of microRNA regulatory networks by integrating multidimensional high-throughput data.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) of approximately 22 nt that regulate the expression of a large fraction of genes by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs). However, determining the biologically significant targets of miRNAs is an ongoing challenge. In this chapter, we describe how to identify miRNA-target interactions and miRNA regulatory networks from high-throughput deep sequencing, CLIP-Seq (HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP) and degradome sequencing data using starBase platforms. In starBase, several web-based and stand-alone computational tools were developed to discover Argonaute (Ago) binding and cleavage sites, miRNA-target interactions, perform enrichment analysis of miRNA target genes in Gene Ontology (GO) categories and biological pathways, and identify combinatorial effects between Ago and other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Investigating target pathways of miRNAs in human CLIP-Seq data, we found that many cancer-associated miRNAs modulate cancer pathways. Performing an enrichment analysis of genes targeted by highly expressed miRNAs in the mouse brain showed that many miRNAs are involved in cancer-associated MAPK signaling and glioma pathways, as well as neuron-associated neurotrophin signaling and axon guidance pathways. Moreover, thousands of combinatorial binding sites between Ago and RBPs were identified from CLIP-Seq data suggesting RBPs and miRNAs coordinately regulate mRNA transcripts. As a means of comprehensively integrating CLIP-Seq and Degradome-Seq data, the starBase platform is expected to identify clinically relevant miRNA-target regulatory relationships, and reveal multi-dimensional post-transcriptional regulatory networks involving miRNAs and RBPs. starBase is available at                  http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/                                .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23394478,Multiple consensus trees: a method to separate divergent genes.,"<h4>Background</h4>It is generally admitted that the species tree cannot be inferred from the genetic sequences of a single gene because the evolution of different genes, and thus the gene tree topologies, may vary substantially. Gene trees can differ, for example, because of horizontal transfer events or because some of them correspond to paralogous instead of orthologous sequences. A variety of methods has been proposed to tackle the problem of the reconciliation of gene trees in order to reconstruct a species tree. When the taxa in all the trees are identical, the problem can be stated as a consensus tree problem.<h4>Results</h4>In this paper we define a new method for deciding whether a unique consensus tree or multiple consensus trees can best represent a set of given phylogenetic trees. If the given trees are all congruent, they should be compatible into a single consensus tree. Otherwise, several consensus trees corresponding to divergent genetic patterns can be identified. We introduce a method optimizing the generalized score, over a set of tree partitions in order to decide whether the given set of gene trees is homogeneous or not.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The proposed method has been validated with simulated data (random trees organized in three topological groups) as well as with real data (bootstrap trees, homogeneous set of trees, and a set of non homogeneous gene trees of 30 E. Coli strains; it is worth noting that some of the latter genes underwent horizontal gene transfers). A computer program, MCT - Multiple Consensus Trees, written in C was made freely available for the research community (it can be downloaded from http://bioinformatics.lif.univ-mrs.fr/consensus/index.html). It handles trees in a standard Newick format, builds three hierarchies corresponding to RF and QS similarities between trees and the greedy ascending algorithm.

Tumor cells that express CD44 and CD24 exhibit a stem-cell-like behavior. CD44 is the binding site for hyaluronic acid, and CD24 is a receptor that interacts with P-selectin to induce metastasis and tumor progression. The present study aims to evaluate the expression of CD44 and CD24 on SGMNs and correlated these data with several clinicopathologic features.<h4>Methods</h4>Immunohistochemical stains for CD44 and CD24 were performed on tissue microarrays containing SGMN samples from 69 patients. The CD44, CD24 and CD44/CD24 expression phenotypes were correlated to patient clinicopathologic features and outcome.<h4>Results</h4>CD44 expression was associated with the primary site of neoplasm (p = 0.046). CD24 was associated with clinical stage III/IV (p = 0.008), T stage (p = 0,27) and lymph node (p = 0,001). The CD44/CD24 profiles were associated with the primary site of injury (p = 0.005), lymph node (p = 0.011) and T stage (p = 0.023). Univariate analysis showed a significant relationship between clinical staging and disease- free survival (p = 0.009), and the overall survival presents relation with male gender (p = 0.011) and metastasis (p = 0.027).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In summary, our investigation confirms that the clinical stage, in accordance with the literature, is the main prognostic factor for SGMN. Additionally, we have presented some evidence that the analysis of isolated CD44 and CD24 immunoexpression or the two combined markers could give prognostic information associated to clinicopathologic features in SGMN.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1284611098470676.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

We first extracted 132 relatively independent physicochemical features from a set of the 544 properties in AAindex1, an amino acid index database. Each feature was utilized to train a classification model with a novel encoding schema for hot spot prediction by the IBk algorithm, an extension of the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. The combinations of the individual classifiers were explored and the classifiers that appeared frequently in the top performing combinations were selected. The hot spot predictor was built based on an ensemble of these classifiers and to work in a voting manner. Experimental results demonstrated that our method effectively exploited the feature space and allowed flexible weights of features for different queries. On the commonly used hot spot benchmark sets, our method significantly outperformed other machine learning algorithms and state-of-the-art hot spot predictors.

23637070,glyXalign: high-throughput migration time alignment preprocessing of electrophoretic data retrieved via multiplexed capillary gel electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection-based glycoprofiling.,"Glycomics has become a rapidly emerging field and monitoring of protein glycosylation is needed to ensure quality and consistency during production processes of biologicals such as therapeutic antibodies or vaccines. Glycoanalysis via multiplexed CGE with LIF detection (xCGE-LIF) represents a powerful technique featuring high resolution, high sensitivity as well as high-throughput performance. However, sample data retrieved from this method exhibit challenges for downstream computational analysis due to intersample migration time shifts as well as stretching and compression of electropherograms. Here, we present glyXalign, a freely available and easy-to-use software package to automatically correct for distortions in xCGE-LIF based glycan data. We demonstrate its ability to outperform conventional algorithms such as dynamic time warping and correlation optimized warping in terms of processing time and alignment accuracy for high-resolution datasets. Built upon a set of rapid algorithms, the tool includes an intuitive graphical user interface and allows full control over all parameters. Additionally, it visualizes the alignment process and enables the user to readjust misaligned results. Software and documentation are available at http://www.glyxera.com.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23664230,Application of the Bayesian approach for derivation of PDFs for concentration ratio values.,"Concentration ratios (CRs) are used to derive activity concentrations in wild plants and animals. Usually, compilations of CR values encompass a wide range of element-organism combinations, extracted from different studies with statistical information reported at varying degrees of detail. To produce a more robust estimation of distribution parameters, data from different studies are normally pooled using classical statistical methods. However, there is inherent subjectivity involved in pooling CR data in the sense that there is a tacit assumption that the CRs under any arbitrarily defined biota category belong to the same population. Here, Bayesian inference has been introduced as an alternative way of making estimates of distribution parameters of CRs. This approach, in contrast to classical methods, is more flexible and also allows us to define the various assumptions required, when combining data, in a more explicit manner. Taking selected data from the recently compiled wildlife transfer database (http://www.wildlifetransferdatabase.org/) as a working example, attempts are made to refine the pooling approaches previously used and to consider situations when empirical data are limited.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,but usedful ref
23685613,Prediction of clustered RNA-binding protein motif sites in the mammalian genome.,"Sequence-specific interactions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with their target transcripts are essential for post-transcriptional gene expression regulation in mammals. However, accurate prediction of RBP motif sites has been difficult because many RBPs recognize short and degenerate sequences. Here we describe a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based algorithm mCarts to predict clustered functional RBP-binding sites by effectively integrating the number and spacing of individual motif sites, their accessibility in local RNA secondary structures and cross-species conservation. This algorithm learns and quantifies rules of these features, taking advantage of a large number of in vivo RBP-binding sites obtained from cross-linking and immunoprecipitation data. We applied this algorithm to study two representative RBP families, Nova and Mbnl, which regulate tissue-specific alternative splicing through interacting with clustered YCAY and YGCY elements, respectively, and predicted their binding sites in the mouse transcriptome. Despite the low information content in individual motif elements, our algorithm made specific predictions for successful experimental validation. Analysis of predicted sites also revealed cases of extensive and distal RBP-binding sites important for splicing regulation. This algorithm can be readily applied to other RBPs to infer their RNA-regulatory networks.

23703214,PiDNA: Predicting protein-DNA interactions with structural models.,"Predicting binding sites of a transcription factor in the genome is an important, but challenging, issue in studying gene regulation. In the past decade, a large number of protein-DNA co-crystallized structures available in the Protein Data Bank have facilitated the understanding of interacting mechanisms between transcription factors and their binding sites. Recent studies have shown that both physics-based and knowledge-based potential functions can be applied to protein-DNA complex structures to deliver position weight matrices (PWMs) that are consistent with the experimental data. To further use the available structural models, the proposed Web server, PiDNA, aims at first constructing reliable PWMs by applying an atomic-level knowledge-based scoring function on numerous in silico mutated complex structures, and then using the PWM constructed by the structure models with small energy changes to predict the interaction between proteins and DNA sequences. With PiDNA, the users can easily predict the relative preference of all the DNA sequences with limited mutations from the native sequence co-crystallized in the model in a single run. More predictions on sequences with unlimited mutations can be realized by additional requests or file uploading. Three types of information can be downloaded after prediction: (i) the ranked list of mutated sequences, (ii) the PWM constructed by the favourable mutated structures, and (iii) any mutated protein-DNA complex structure models specified by the user. This study first shows that the constructed PWMs are similar to the annotated PWMs collected from databases or literature. Second, the prediction accuracy of PiDNA in detecting relatively high-specificity sites is evaluated by comparing the ranked lists against in vitro experiments from protein-binding microarrays. Finally, PiDNA is shown to be able to select the experimentally validated binding sites from 10,000 random sites with high accuracy. With PiDNA, the users can design biological experiments based on the predicted sequence specificity and/or request mutated structure models for further protein design. As well, it is expected that PiDNA can be incorporated with chromatin immunoprecipitation data to refine large-scale inference of in vivo protein-DNA interactions.

23732274,AuthorReward: increasing community curation in biological knowledge wikis through automated authorship quantification.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Community curation-harnessing community intelligence in knowledge curation, bears great promise in dealing with the flood of biological knowledge. To exploit the full potential of the scientific community for knowledge curation, multiple biological wikis (bio-wikis) have been built to date. However, none of them have achieved a substantial impact on knowledge curation. One of the major limitations in bio-wikis is insufficient community participation, which is intrinsically because of lack of explicit authorship and thus no credit for community curation. To increase community curation in bio-wikis, here we develop AuthorReward, an extension to MediaWiki, to reward community-curated efforts in knowledge curation. AuthorReward quantifies researchers' contributions by properly factoring both edit quantity and quality and yields automated explicit authorship according to their quantitative contributions. AuthorReward provides bio-wikis with an authorship metric, helpful to increase community participation in bio-wikis and to achieve community curation of massive biological knowledge.<h4>Availability</h4>http://cbb.big.ac.cn/software.<h4>Contact</h4>zhangzhang@big.ac.cn<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23737449,antiSMASH 2.0--a versatile platform for genome mining of secondary metabolite producers.,"Microbial secondary metabolites are a potent source of antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. Genome mining of their biosynthetic gene clusters has become a key method to accelerate their identification and characterization. In 2011, we developed antiSMASH, a web-based analysis platform that automates this process. Here, we present the highly improved antiSMASH 2.0 release, available at http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/. For the new version, antiSMASH was entirely re-designed using a plug-and-play concept that allows easy integration of novel predictor or output modules. antiSMASH 2.0 now supports input of multiple related sequences simultaneously (multi-FASTA/GenBank/EMBL), which allows the analysis of draft genomes comprising multiple contigs. Moreover, direct analysis of protein sequences is now possible. antiSMASH 2.0 has also been equipped with the capacity to detect additional classes of secondary metabolites, including oligosaccharide antibiotics, phenazines, thiopeptides, homo-serine lactones, phosphonates and furans. The algorithm for predicting the core structure of the cluster end product is now also covering lantipeptides, in addition to polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides. The antiSMASH ClusterBlast functionality has been extended to identify sub-clusters involved in the biosynthesis of specific chemical building blocks. The new features currently make antiSMASH 2.0 the most comprehensive resource for identifying and analyzing novel secondary metabolite biosynthetic pathways in microorganisms.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23771137,Secondary structure and domain architecture of the 23S and 5S rRNAs.,"We present a de novo re-determination of the secondary (2�) structure and domain architecture of the 23S and 5S rRNAs, using 3D structures, determined by X-ray diffraction, as input. In the traditional 2� structure, the center of the 23S rRNA is an extended single strand, which in 3D is seen to be compact and double helical. Accurately assigning nucleotides to helices compels a revision of the 23S rRNA 2� structure. Unlike the traditional 2� structure, the revised 2� structure of the 23S rRNA shows architectural similarity with the 16S rRNA. The revised 2� structure also reveals a clear relationship with the 3D structure and is generalizable to rRNAs of other species from all three domains of life. The 2� structure revision required us to reconsider the domain architecture. We partitioned the 23S rRNA into domains through analysis of molecular interactions, calculations of 2D folding propensities and compactness. The best domain model for the 23S rRNA contains seven domains, not six as previously ascribed. Domain 0 forms the core of the 23S rRNA, to which the other six domains are rooted. Editable 2� structures mapped with various data are provided (http://apollo.chemistry.gatech.edu/RibosomeGallery).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,kinda iffy
23823315,"CluGene: A Bioinformatics Framework for the Identification of Co-Localized, Co-Expressed and Co-Regulated Genes Aimed at the Investigation of Transcriptional Regulatory Networks from High-Throughput Expression Data.","The full understanding of the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulatory networks requires unravelling of complex causal relationships. Genome high-throughput technologies produce a huge amount of information pertaining gene expression and regulation; however, the complexity of the available data is often overwhelming and tools are needed to extract and organize the relevant information. This work starts from the assumption that the observation of co-occurrent events (in particular co-localization, co-expression and co-regulation) may provide a powerful starting point to begin unravelling transcriptional regulatory networks. Co-expressed genes often imply shared functional pathways; co-expressed and functionally related genes are often co-localized, too; moreover, co-expressed and co-localized genes are also potential targets for co-regulation; finally, co-regulation seems more frequent for genes mapped to proximal chromosome regions. Despite the recognized importance of analysing co-occurrent events, no bioinformatics solution allowing the simultaneous analysis of co-expression, co-localization and co-regulation is currently available. Our work resulted in developing and valuating CluGene, a software providing tools to analyze multiple types of co-occurrences within a single interactive environment allowing the interactive investigation of combined co-expression, co-localization and co-regulation of genes. The use of CluGene will enhance the power of testing hypothesis and experimental approaches aimed at unravelling transcriptional regulatory networks.

23824634,Validating a Coarse-Grained Potential Energy Function through Protein Loop Modelling.,"Coarse-grained (CG) methods for sampling protein conformational space have the potential to increase computational efficiency by reducing the degrees of freedom. The gain in computational efficiency of CG methods often comes at the expense of non-protein like local conformational features. This could cause problems when transitioning to full atom models in a hierarchical framework. Here, a CG potential energy function was validated by applying it to the problem of loop prediction. A novel method to sample the conformational space of backbone atoms was benchmarked using a standard test set consisting of 351 distinct loops. This method used a sequence-independent CG potential energy function representing the protein using [Formula: see text]-carbon positions only and sampling conformations with a Monte Carlo simulated annealing based protocol. Backbone atoms were added using a method previously described and then gradient minimised in the Rosetta force field. Despite the CG potential energy function being sequence-independent, the method performed similarly to methods that explicitly use either fragments of known protein backbones with similar sequences or residue-specific [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text]-maps to restrict the search space. The method was also able to predict with sub-Angstrom accuracy two out of seven loops from recently solved crystal structures of proteins with low sequence and structure similarity to previously deposited structures in the PDB. The ability to sample realistic loop conformations directly from a potential energy function enables the incorporation of additional geometric restraints and the use of more advanced sampling methods in a way that is not possible to do easily with fragment replacement methods and also enable multi-scale simulations for protein design and protein structure prediction. These restraints could be derived from experimental data or could be design restraints in the case of computational protein design.

23829391,An untargeted metabolomic workflow to improve structural characterization of metabolites.,"Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics relies on MS(2) data for structural characterization of metabolites. To obtain the high-quality MS(2) data necessary to support metabolite identifications, ions of interest must be purely isolated for fragmentation. Here, we show that metabolomic MS(2) data are frequently characterized by contaminating ions that prevent structural identification. Although using narrow-isolation windows can minimize contaminating MS(2) fragments, even narrow windows are not always selective enough, and they can complicate data analysis by removing isotopic patterns from MS(2) spectra. Moreover, narrow windows can significantly reduce sensitivity. In this work, we introduce a novel, two-part approach for performing metabolomic identifications that addresses these issues. First, we collect MS(2) scans with less stringent isolation settings to obtain improved sensitivity at the expense of specificity. Then, by evaluating MS(2) fragment intensities as a function of retention time and precursor mass targeted for MS(2) analysis, we obtain deconvolved MS(2) spectra that are consistent with pure standards and can therefore be used for metabolite identification. The value of our approach is highlighted with metabolic extracts from brain, liver, astrocytes, as well as nerve tissue, and performance is evaluated by using pure metabolite standards in combination with simulations based on raw MS(2) data from the METLIN metabolite database. A R package implementing the algorithms used in our workflow is available on our laboratory website ( http://pattilab.wustl.edu/decoms2.php ).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23851377,CoLIde: a bioinformatics tool for CO-expression-based small RNA Loci Identification using high-throughput sequencing data.,"Small RNAs (sRNAs) are 20-25 nt non-coding RNAs that act as guides for the highly sequence-specific regulatory mechanism known as RNA silencing. Due to the recent increase in sequencing depth, a highly complex and diverse population of sRNAs in both plants and animals has been revealed. However, the exponential increase in sequencing data has also made the identification of individual sRNA transcripts corresponding to biological units (sRNA loci) more challenging when based exclusively on the genomic location of the constituent sRNAs, hindering existing approaches to identify sRNA loci. To infer the location of significant biological units, we propose an approach for sRNA loci detection called CoLIde (Co-expression based sRNA Loci Identification) that combines genomic location with the analysis of other information such as variation in expression levels (expression pattern) and size class distribution. For CoLIde, we define a locus as a union of regions sharing the same pattern and located in close proximity on the genome. Biological relevance, detected through the analysis of size class distribution, is also calculated for each locus. CoLIde can be applied on ordered (e.g., time-dependent) or un-ordered (e.g., organ, mutant) series of samples both with or without biological/technical replicates. The method reliably identifies known types of loci and shows improved performance on sequencing data from both plants (e.g., A. thaliana, S. lycopersicum) and animals (e.g., D. melanogaster) when compared with existing locus detection techniques. CoLIde is available for use within the UEA Small RNA Workbench which can be downloaded from: http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23853063,Exhaustively characterizing feasible logic models of a signaling network using Answer Set Programming.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Logic modeling is a useful tool to study signal transduction across multiple pathways. Logic models can be generated by training a network containing the prior knowledge to phospho-proteomics data. The training can be performed using stochastic optimization procedures, but these are unable to guarantee a global optima or to report the complete family of feasible models. This, however, is essential to provide precise insight in the mechanisms underlaying signal transduction and generate reliable predictions.<h4>Results</h4>We propose the use of Answer Set Programming to explore exhaustively the space of feasible logic models. Toward this end, we have developed caspo, an open-source Python package that provides a powerful platform to learn and characterize logic models by leveraging the rich modeling language and solving technologies of Answer Set Programming. We illustrate the usefulness of caspo by revisiting a model of pro-growth and inflammatory pathways in liver cells. We show that, if experimental error is taken into account, there are thousands (11 700) of models compatible with the data. Despite the large number, we can extract structural features from the models, such as links that are always (or never) present or modules that appear in a mutual exclusive fashion. To further characterize this family of models, we investigate the input-output behavior of the models. We find 91 behaviors across the 11 700 models and we suggest new experiments to discriminate among them. Our results underscore the importance of characterizing in a global and exhaustive manner the family of feasible models, with important implications for experimental design.<h4>Availability</h4>caspo is freely available for download (license GPLv3) and as a web service at http://caspo.genouest.org/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary materials are available at Bioinformatics online.<h4>Contact</h4>santiago.videla@irisa.fr.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Main outcomes were 1) linear growth from 6 to 12 mo of age; 2) hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron [serum ferritin (SF)], and zinc status at 12 mo of age; and 3) meat intake at 12 mo of age (by using a food-frequency questionnaire).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 38 infants/group provided data at 12 mo of age. NGG infants had significantly higher red meat intake [mean � SD: 5.4 � 1.8 compared with 3.5 � 1.7 d/wk at 12 mo of age; P < 0.001), higher hemoglobin and hematocrit at 12 mo of age, and a significantly greater increase in hemoglobin (mean � SD change: 0.41 � 0.8 compared with -0.13 � 1.0; P = 0.01) and hematocrit (1.04 � 2.2 compared with -0.15 � 2.4; P = 0.03) from 6 to 12 mo of age than those in CG infants. There were no significant differences in linear growth from 6 to 12 mo of age or in SF or zinc.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new guidelines showed efficacy with higher red meat intake and positive effects on hemoglobin and hematocrit.

23956306,Incorporating prior knowledge into Gene Network Study.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>A major goal in genomic research is to identify genes that may jointly influence a biological response. From many years of intensive biomedical research, a large body of biological knowledge, or pathway information, has accumulated in available databases. There is a strong interest in leveraging these pathways to improve the statistical power and interpretability in studying gene networks associated with complex phenotypes. This prior information is a valuable complement to large-scale genomic data such as gene expression data generated from microarrays. However, it is a non-trivial task to effectively integrate available biological knowledge into gene expression data when reconstructing gene networks.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we developed and applied a Lasso method from a Bayesian perspective, a method we call prior Lasso (pLasso), for the reconstruction of gene networks. In this method, we partition edges between genes into two subsets: one subset of edges is present in known pathways, whereas the other has no prior information associated. Our method assigns different prior distributions to each subset according to a modified Bayesian information criterion that incorporates prior knowledge on both the network structure and the pathway information. Simulation studies have indicated that the method is more effective in recovering the underlying network than a traditional Lasso method that does not use the prior information. We applied pLasso to microarray gene expression datasets, where we used information from the Pathway Commons (PC) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) as prior information for the network reconstruction, and successfully identified network hub genes associated with clinical outcome in cancer patients.<h4>Availability</h4>The source code is available at http://nba.uth.tmc.edu/homepage/liu/pLasso.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

It contains two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and about 147 bp of DNA. The residues of the histone proteins are subject to numerous post-translational modifications, such as methylation or acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitiation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technique that provides genome-wide occupancy data of these modified histone proteins, and it requires appropriate computational methods.<h4>Results</h4>We present NucHunter, an algorithm that uses the data from ChIP-seq experiments directed against many histone modifications to infer positioned nucleosomes. NucHunter annotates each of these nucleosomes with the intensities of the histone modifications. We demonstrate that these annotations can be used to infer nucleosomal states with distinct correlations to underlying genomic features and chromatin-related processes, such as transcriptional start sites, enhancers, elongation by RNA polymerase II and chromatin-mediated repression. Thus, NucHunter is a versatile tool that can be used to predict positioned nucleosomes from a panel of histone modification ChIP-seq experiments and infer distinct histone modification patterns associated to different chromatin states.<h4>Availability</h4>The software is available at http://epigen.molgen.mpg.de/nuchunter/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Achievements in this area are expected to result in effective drug design (especially for HIV-1 protease inhibitors) against this life-threatening virus. However, some drawbacks (like the shortage of the available training data and the high dimensionality of the feature space) turn this task into a difficult classification problem. Thus, various machine learning techniques, and specifically several classification methods have been proposed in order to increase the accuracy of the classification model. In addition, for several classification problems, which are characterized by having few samples and many features, selecting the most relevant features is a major factor for increasing classification accuracy.<h4>Results</h4>We propose for HIV-1 data a consistency-based feature selection approach in conjunction with recursive feature elimination of support vector machines (SVMs). We used various classifiers for evaluating the results obtained from the feature selection process. We further demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing it with a state-of-the-art feature selection method applied on HIV-1 data, and we evaluated the reported results based on attributes which have been selected from different combinations.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Applying feature selection on training data before realizing the classification task seems to be a reasonable data-mining process when working with types of data similar to HIV-1. On HIV-1 data, some feature selection or extraction operations in conjunction with different classifiers have been tested and noteworthy outcomes have been reported. These facts motivate for the work presented in this paper.<h4>Software availability</h4>The software is available at http://ozyer.etu.edu.tr/c-fs-svm.rar.

24108511,Antibiotics for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry.,"<h4>Background</h4>Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the chambers of the heart with a high mortality rate.Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it was believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries have recommended that prior to invasive dental procedures antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, recent guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales has recommended that antibiotics are not required.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no such administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis.<h4>Search methods</h4>The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 21 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 21 January 2013) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 21 January 2013). We searched for ongoing trials in the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (http://www.controlled-trials.com/mrct/). No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>Due to the low incidence of BE it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case-control studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of antibiotic, compared to no such administration, before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those individuals at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping by whether prophylaxis was received or not. Included case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing an invasive dental procedure preceding the onset of endocarditis) with those at similar risk but who had not developed endocarditis. Outcomes of interest were mortality or serious adverse events requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse events to the antibiotics; and cost implications of the antibiotic provision for the care of those patients who developed endocarditis.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion then assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included study.<h4>Main results</h4>No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included. One case-control study met the inclusion criteria. It collected all the cases of endocarditis in the Netherlands over two years, finding a total of 24 people who developed endocarditis within 180 days of an invasive dental procedure, definitely requiring prophylaxis according to current guidelines, and who were at increased risk of endocarditis due to a pre-existing cardiac problem. This study included participants who died because of the endocarditis (using proxies). Controls attended local cardiology outpatient clinics for similar cardiac problems, had undergone an invasive dental procedure within the past 180 days, and were matched by age with the cases. No significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis could be seen. No data were found on other outcomes.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>There remains no evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically, practitioners need to discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Eligible participants were continent men with an International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5) score of at least 18, scheduled to undergo nerve-sparing RP. Patients were randomized to a PVS group or a control group. Patients in the PVS group were instructed in using a PVS device (FERTI CARE(�) vibrator). Stimulation was performed at the frenulum once daily by the patients in their own homes for at least 1 week before surgery. After catheter removal, daily PVS was re-initiated for a period of 6 weeks. Participants were evaluated at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery with the IIEF-5 questionnaire and questions regarding urinary bother. Patients using up to one pad daily for security reasons only were considered continent. The study was registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ (NCT01067261).<h4>Results</h4>Data from 68 patients were available for analyses (30 patients randomized to PVS and 38 patients randomized to the control group). The IIEF-5 score was highest in the PVS group at all time points after surgery with a median score of 18 vs 7.5 in the control group at 12 months (P = 0.09), but the difference only reached borderline significance. At 12 months, 16/30 (53%) patients in the PVS group had reached an IIEF-5 score of at least 18, while this was the case for 12/38 (32%) patients in the control group (P = 0.07). There were no significant differences in the proportions of continent patients between groups at 3, 6 or 12 months.

24170398,T-Coffee: Tree-based consistency objective function for alignment evaluation.,"T-Coffee, for Tree-based consistency objective function for alignment evaluation, is a versatile multiple sequence alignment (MSA) method suitable for aligning virtually any type of biological sequences. T-Coffee provides more than a simple sequence aligner; rather it is a framework in which alternative alignment methods and/or extra information (i.e., structural, evolutionary, or experimental information) can be combined to reach more accurate and more meaningful MSAs. T-Coffee can be used either by running input data via the Web server ( http://tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/tcoffee/index.html ) or by downloading the T-Coffee package. Here, we present how the package can be used in its command line mode to carry out the most common tasks and multiply align proteins, DNA, and RNA sequences. This chapter particularly emphasizes on the description of T-Coffee special flavors also called """"modes,"""" designed to address particular biological problems.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Accurate MSA construction for divergent proteins remains a difficult computational task. The constantly increasing protein sequences and structures in public databases could be used to improve alignment quality. PROMALS3D is a tool for protein MSA construction enhanced with additional evolutionary and structural information from database searches. PROMALS3D automatically identifies homologs from sequence and structure databases for input proteins, derives structure-based constraints from alignments of three-dimensional structures, and combines them with sequence-based constraints of profile-profile alignments in a consistency-based framework to construct high-quality multiple sequence alignments. PROMALS3D output is a consensus alignment enriched with sequence and structural information about input proteins and their homologs.

24250114,SNPAAMapper: An efficient genome-wide SNP variant analysis pipeline for next-generation sequencing data.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Many NGS analysis tools focusing on read alignment and variant calling functions for exome sequencing data have been developed in recent years. However, publicly available tools dealing with the downstream analysis of genome-wide variants are fewer and have limited functionality. We developed SNPAAMapper, a novel variant analysis pipeline that can effectively classify variants by region (e.g. CDS, UTRs, intron, upstream, downstream), predict amino acid change type (e.g. synonymous, non-synonymous mutation), and prioritize mutation effects (e.g. CDS versus UTRs). Additional functionality afforded by our pipeline includes: checking variants at exon/intron junctions, customized homozygosity and allele frequency cutoff parameters, and annotation of known variants with dbSNP information, listing original and mutated amino acid sequences containing variants. The final result is reported in a spreadsheet format table containing all variant associated information and prioritized amino acids effects for investigators to examine.<h4>Availability</h4>Perl scripts and required input files are available on the web at http://www.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ccdu /SNPAAMapper.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
24259518,Quantitative proteomic profiling reveals novel region-specific markers in the adult mouse brain.,"Despite major advances in neuroscience, a comprehensive understanding of the structural and functional components of the adult brain compartments remains to be fully elucidated at a quantitative molecular level. Indeed, over half of the soluble- and membrane-annotated proteins are currently unmapped within online digital brain atlases. In this study, two complementary approaches were used to assess the unique repertoire of proteins enriched within select regions of the adult mouse CNS, including the brain stem, cerebellum, and remaining brain hemispheres. Of the 1200 proteins visualized by 2D-DIGE, approximately 150 (including cytosolic and membrane proteins) were found to exhibit statistically significant changes in relative abundance thus representing putative region-specific brain markers. In addition to using a high-precision (18) O-labeling strategy for the quantitative LC-MS/MS mapping of membrane proteins isolated from myelin-enriched fractions, we have identified over 1000 proteins that have yet to be described in any other mammalian myelin proteome. A comparison of our myelin proteome was made to an existing transcriptome database containing mRNA abundance profiles during oligodendrocyte differentiation and has confirmed statistically significant abundance changes for ~500 of these newly mapped proteins, thus revealing new roles in oligodendrocyte and myelin biology. These data offer a resource for the neuroscience community studying the molecular basis for specialized neuronal activities in the CNS and myelin-related disorders.

We identified proteins recruited after irradiation in nucleoids of Deinococcus radiodurans and Deinococcus deserti by means of comparative proteomics. Proteins in nucleoid-enriched fractions from unirradiated and irradiated Deinococcus were identified and semiquantified by shotgun proteomics. The ssDNA-binding protein SSB, DNA gyrase subunits GyrA and GyrB, DNA topoisomerase I, RecA recombinase, UvrA excinuclease, RecQ helicase, DdrA, DdrB, and DdrD proteins were found in significantly higher amounts in irradiated nucleoids of both Deinococcus species. We observed, by immunofluorescence microscopy, the subcellular localization of these proteins in D. radiodurans, showing for the first time the recruitment of the DdrD protein into the D. radiodurans nucleoid. We specifically followed the kinetics of recruitment of RecA, DdrA, and DdrD to the nucleoid after irradiation. Remarkably, RecA proteins formed irregular filament-like structures 1 h after irradiation, before being redistributed throughout the cells by 3 h post-irradiation. Comparable dynamics of DdrD localization were observed, suggesting a possible functional interaction between RecA and DdrD. Several proteins involved in nucleotide synthesis were also seen in higher quantities in the nucleoids of irradiated cells, indicative of the existence of a mechanism for orchestrating the presence of proteins involved in DNA metabolism in nucleoids in response to massive DNA damage.

24312116,The power of regional heritability analysis for rare and common variant detection: simulations and application to eye biometrical traits.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of complex traits. However, they have explained relatively little trait heritability. Recently, we proposed a new analytical approach called regional heritability mapping (RHM) that captures more of the missing genetic variation. This method is applicable both to related and unrelated populations. Here, we demonstrate the power of RHM in comparison with single-SNP GWAS and gene-based association approaches under a wide range of scenarios with variable numbers of quantitative trait loci (QTL) with common and rare causal variants in a narrow genomic region. Simulations based on real genotype data were performed to assess power to capture QTL variance, and we demonstrate that RHM has greater power to detect rare variants and/or multiple alleles in a region than other approaches. In addition, we show that RHM can capture more accurately the QTL variance, when it is caused by multiple independent effects and/or rare variants. We applied RHM to analyze three biometrical eye traits for which single-SNP GWAS have been published or performed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in real data analysis and detected some additional loci which were not detected by other GWAS methods. RHM has the potential to explain some of missing heritability by capturing variance caused by QTL with low MAF and multiple independent QTL in a region, not captured by other GWAS methods. RHM analyses can be implemented using the software REACTA (http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/projects-portfolio/reacta).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

24334622,Metagenomic frameworks for monitoring antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments.,"<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput genomic technologies offer new approaches for environmental health monitoring, including metagenomic surveillance of antibiotic resistance determinants (ARDs). Although natural environments serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes that can be transferred to pathogenic and human commensal bacteria, monitoring of these determinants has been infrequent and incomplete. Furthermore, surveillance efforts have not been integrated into public health decision making.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used a metagenomic epidemiology-based approach to develop an ARD index that quantifies antibiotic resistance potential, and we analyzed this index for common modal patterns across environmental samples. We also explored how metagenomic data such as this index could be conceptually framed within an early risk management context.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed 25 published data sets from shotgun pyrosequencing projects. The samples consisted of microbial community DNA collected from marine and freshwater environments across a gradient of human impact. We used principal component analysis to identify index patterns across samples.<h4>Results</h4>We observed significant differences in the overall index and index subcategory levels when comparing ecosystems more proximal versus distal to human impact. The selection of different sequence similarity thresholds strongly influenced the index measurements. Unique index subcategory modes distinguished the different metagenomes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Broad-scale screening of ARD potential using this index revealed utility for framing environmental health monitoring and surveillance. This approach holds promise as a screening tool for establishing baseline ARD levels that can be used to inform and prioritize decision making regarding management of ARD sources and human exposure routes.<h4>Citation</h4>Port JA, Cullen AC, Wallace JC, Smith MN, Faustman EM. 2014.

A subtle and microscopically undetectable chromosomal alteration is uniparental disomy (UPD), which is known to be associated with distinct birth defects as per the chromosome involved and parental origin. UPD can be evident due to imprinted genes and/or activation of recessive mutations.<h4>Aims</h4>The present study comprises of data mining of published UPD cases with a focus on associated phenotypes. The goal was to identify non-random and recurrent associations between UPD and various genetic conditions, which can possibly indicate the presence of new imprinted genes.<h4>Settings and design</h4>Data mining was carried out using the homepage """"http://www.fish.uniklinikum-jena.de/UPD.html."""", an online catalog of published cases with UPD.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The UPD cases having normal karyotype and with or without clinical findings were selected to analyze the associated phenotypes for each chromosome, maternal or paternal involved in UPD.<h4>Results</h4>Our results revealed many genetic conditions (other than the known UPD syndromes) to be associated with UPD. Even in cases of bad obstetric history as well as normal individuals chance detection of UPD has been reported.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The role of UPD in human genetic disorders needs to be studied by involving larger cohorts of individuals with birth defects as well as normal population. The genetic conditions were scrutinized in terms of inheritance patterns; majority of these were autosomal recessive indicating the role of UPD as an underlying mechanism.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
24367574,Switch of sensitivity dynamics revealed with DyGloSA toolbox for dynamical global sensitivity analysis as an early warning for system's critical transition.,"Systems with bifurcations may experience abrupt irreversible and often unwanted shifts in their performance, called critical transitions. For many systems like climate, economy, ecosystems it is highly desirable to identify indicators serving as early warnings of such regime shifts. Several statistical measures were recently proposed as early warnings of critical transitions including increased variance, autocorrelation and skewness of experimental or model-generated data. The lack of automatized tool for model-based prediction of critical transitions led to designing DyGloSA - a MATLAB toolbox for dynamical global parameter sensitivity analysis (GPSA) of ordinary differential equations models. We suggest that the switch in dynamics of parameter sensitivities revealed by our toolbox is an early warning that a system is approaching a critical transition. We illustrate the efficiency of our toolbox by analyzing several models with bifurcations and predicting the time periods when systems can still avoid going to a critical transition by manipulating certain parameter values, which is not detectable with the existing SA techniques. DyGloSA is based on the SBToolbox2 and contains functions, which compute dynamically the global sensitivity indices of the system by applying four main GPSA methods: eFAST, Sobol's ANOVA, PRCC and WALS. It includes parallelized versions of the functions enabling significant reduction of the computational time (up to 12 times). DyGloSA is freely available as a set of MATLAB scripts at http://bio.uni.lu/systems_biology/software/dyglosa. It requires installation of MATLAB (versions R2008b or later) and the Systems Biology Toolbox2 available at www.sbtoolbox2.org.

Videos illustrated aspects of language, sophistication of play and socialisation, cognition, and motor progress. Expert commentary, teaching text and summaries were used. A randomised controlled trial evaluated the resource. Paediatric trainees were recruited from The Sydney Children's Hospitals Network. Outcome measures were repeated at three time points (pre-teaching, immediate-post and 1 month) and included self-rated attitudes, knowledge of markers of development and observational expertise. Qualitative data on teaching usefulness were obtained through open-ended questions.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-six paediatric trainees (registrar 79%, women 82%; mean age 31 years) completed the pre-assessment, 46 the immediate-post and 45 the 1-month follow-up (20% attrition). Compared with the Control group, the Teaching group scored higher over time on markers of development (P = 0.006), observational expertise (P < 0.0001), confidence (P = 0.035) and satisfaction (P < 0.0001).

24507755,Systematic characterization of small RNAome during zebrafish early developmental stages.,"<h4>Background</h4>During early vertebrate development, various small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) such as MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are dynamically expressed for orchestrating the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). Systematic analysis of expression profiles of zebrafish small RNAome will be greatly helpful for understanding the sRNA regulation during embryonic development.<h4>Results</h4>We first determined the expression profiles of sRNAs during eight distinct stages of early zebrafish development by sRNA-seq technology. Integrative analyses with a new computational platform of CSZ (characterization of small RNAome for zebrafish) demonstrated an sRNA class transition from piRNAs to miRNAs as development proceeds. We observed that both the abundance and diversity of miRNAs are gradually increased, while the abundance is enhanced more dramatically than the diversity during development. However, although both the abundance and diversity of piRNAs are gradually decreased, the diversity was firstly increased then rapidly decreased. To evaluate the computational accuracy, the expression levels of four known miRNAs were experimentally validated. We also predicted 25 potentially novel miRNAs, whereas two candidates were verified by Northern blots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Taken together, our analyses revealed the piRNA to miRNA transition as a conserved mechanism in zebrafish, although two different types of sRNAs exhibit distinct expression dynamics in abundance and diversity, respectively. Our study not only generated a better understanding for sRNA regulations in early zebrafish development, but also provided a useful platform for analyzing sRNA-seq data.

Given the high-throughput mass spectrometry-based experiments, the desire to annotate the catalytic kinases for in vivo phosphorylation sites has motivated. Thus, a variety of computational methods have been developed for performing a large-scale prediction of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites. However, most of the proposed methods solely rely on the local amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphorylation sites. An increasing number of three-dimensional structures make it possible to physically investigate the structural environment of phosphorylation sites.<h4>Results</h4>In this work, all of the experimental phosphorylation sites are mapped to the protein entries of Protein Data Bank by sequence identity. It resulted in a total of 4508 phosphorylation sites containing the protein three-dimensional (3D) structures. To identify phosphorylation sites on protein 3D structures, this work incorporates support vector machines (SVMs) with the information of linear motifs and spatial amino acid composition, which is determined for each kinase group by calculating the relative frequencies of 20 amino acid types within a specific radial distance from central phosphorylated amino acid residue. After the cross-validation evaluation, most of the kinase-specific models trained with the consideration of structural information outperform the models considering only the sequence information. Furthermore, the independent testing set which is not included in training set has demonstrated that the proposed method could provide a comparable performance to other popular tools.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The proposed method is shown to be capable of predicting kinase-specific phosphorylation sites on 3D structures and has been implemented as a web server which is freely accessible at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/PhosK3D/. Due to the difficulty of identifying the kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with similar sequenced motifs, this work also integrates the 3D structural information to improve the cross classifying specificity.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not found

BRAF(V600E) mutation and DNA methylation are useful markers to distinguish malignant thyroid neoplasm from benign. The aim of this study was to determine whether combined detection of BRAF(V600E) mutation and methylation markers on FNABs could improve the diagnostic accuracy of thyroid cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>Using pyrosequencing and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) methods, FNABs from 79 and 38 patients with thyroid nodules in training and test groups, respectively, were analyzed for BRAF(V600E) mutation and gene methylation.<h4>Results</h4>BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 30/42 (71.4%) and 14/20 (70%) FNABs in training and test groups, respectively. All BRAF(V600E)-positive samples were histologically diagnosed as papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) after thyroidectomy. As expected, BRAF mutation was not found in all benign nodules. Moreover, we demonstrated that the five genes, including CALCA, DAPK1, TIMP3, RAR-beta and RASSF1A, were aberrantly methylated in FNABs. Of them, methylation level of DAPK1 in PTCs was significantly higher than that in benign samples (P <0.0001). Conversely, methylation level of RASSF1A in PTCs was significantly lower than that in benign samples (P =0.003). Notably, compared with BRAF mutation testing alone, combined detection of BRAF mutation and methylation markers increased the diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of PTC with excellent specificity.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our data have demonstrated that combine analysis of BRAF mutation and DNA methylation markers on FNABs may be a useful strategy to facilitate the diagnosis of malignant thyroid neoplasm, particularly PTC.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/6080878071149177.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

24843014,APOBEC3A deaminates transiently exposed single-strand DNA during LINE-1 retrotransposition.,"Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes. Human cells have therefore evolved strategies to regulate L1 retrotransposition. The APOBEC3 (A3) gene family consists of seven enzymes that catalyze deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides (C-to-U) in single-strand DNA substrates. Among these enzymes, APOBEC3A (A3A) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retrotransposition in cultured cell assays. However, previous characterization of L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A did not yield evidence of deamination. Thus, the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained enigmatic. Here, we have used in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. These data provide a mechanistic explanation of how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02008.001.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
24849626,The inhibitory microcircuit of the substantia nigra provides feedback gain control of the basal ganglia output.,"Dysfunction of the basal ganglia produces severe deficits in the timing, initiation, and vigor of movement. These diverse impairments suggest a control system gone awry. In engineered systems, feedback is critical for control. By contrast, models of the basal ganglia highlight feedforward circuitry and ignore intrinsic feedback circuits. In this study, we show that feedback via axon collaterals of substantia nigra projection neurons control the gain of the basal ganglia output. Through a combination of physiology, optogenetics, anatomy, and circuit mapping, we elaborate a general circuit mechanism for gain control in a microcircuit lacking interneurons. Our data suggest that diverse tonic firing rates, weak unitary connections and a spatially diffuse collateral circuit with distinct topography and kinetics from feedforward input is sufficient to implement divisive feedback inhibition. The importance of feedback for engineered systems implies that the intranigral microcircuit, despite its absence from canonical models, could be essential to basal ganglia function.

24861626,A web tool for the design and management of panels of genes for targeted enrichment and massive sequencing for clinical applications.,"Disease targeted sequencing is gaining importance as a powerful and cost-effective application of high throughput sequencing technologies to the diagnosis. However, the lack of proper tools to process the data hinders its extensive adoption. Here we present TEAM, an intuitive and easy-to-use web tool that fills the gap between the predicted mutations and the final diagnostic in targeted enrichment sequencing analysis. The tool searches for known diagnostic mutations, corresponding to a disease panel, among the predicted patient's variants. Diagnostic variants for the disease are taken from four databases of disease-related variants (HGMD-public, HUMSAVAR, ClinVar and COSMIC.) If no primary diagnostic variant is found, then a list of secondary findings that can help to establish a diagnostic is produced. TEAM also provides with an interface for the definition of and customization of panels, by means of which, genes and mutations can be added or discarded to adjust panel definitions.

24889386,Imported Plasmodium vivax malaria ex Pakistan.,"<h4>Background</h4>According to WHO, 1.5 million cases of malaria are reported annually in Pakistan. Malaria distribution in Pakistan is heterogeneous, and some areas, including Punjab, are considered at low risk for malaria. The aim of this study is to describe the trend of imported malaria cases from Pakistan reported to the international surveillance systems from 2005 to 2012.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinics reporting malaria cases acquired after a stay in Pakistan between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, were identified from the GeoSentinel (http://www.geosentinel.org) and EuroTravNet (http://www.Eurotravnet.eu) networks. Demographic and travel-related information was retrieved from the database and further information such as areas of destination within Pakistan was obtained directly from the reporting sites. Standard linear regression models were used to assess the statistical significance of the time trend.<h4>Results</h4>From January 2005 to December 2012, a total of 63 cases of malaria acquired in Pakistan were retrieved in six countries over three continents. A statistically significant increasing trend in imported Plasmodium vivax malaria cases acquired in Pakistan, particularly for those exposed in Punjab, was observed over time (p = 0.006).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our observation may herald a variation in malaria incidence in the Punjab province of Pakistan. This is in contrast with the previously described decreasing incidence of malaria in travelers to the Indian subcontinent, and with reports that describe Punjab as a low risk area for malaria. Nevertheless, this event is considered plausible by international organizations. This has potential implications for changes in chemoprophylaxis options and reinforces the need for increased surveillance, also considering the risk of introduction of autochthonous P. vivax malaria in areas where competent vectors are present, such as Europe.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
24965847,H-DROP: an SVM based helical domain linker predictor trained with features optimized by combining random forest and stepwise selection.,"Domain linker prediction is attracting much interest as it can help identifying novel domains suitable for high throughput proteomics analysis. Here, we report H-DROP, an SVM-based Helical Domain linker pRediction using OPtimal features. H-DROP is, to the best of our knowledge, the first predictor for specifically and effectively identifying helical linkers. This was made possible first because a large training dataset became available from IS-Dom, and second because we selected a small number of optimal features from a huge number of potential ones. The training helical linker dataset, which included 261 helical linkers, was constructed by detecting helical residues at the boundary regions of two independent structural domains listed in our previously reported IS-Dom dataset. 45 optimal feature candidates were selected from 3,000 features by random forest, which were further reduced to 26 optimal features by stepwise selection. The prediction sensitivity and precision of H-DROP were 35.2 and 38.8%, respectively. These values were over 10.7% higher than those of control methods including our previously developed DROP, which is a coil linker predictor, and PPRODO, which is trained with un-differentiated domain boundary sequences. Overall, these results indicated that helical linkers can be predicted from sequence information alone by using a strictly curated training data set for helical linkers and carefully selected set of optimal features.

25022716,Impact of prophylactic central neck dissection on oncologic outcomes of papillary thyroid carcinoma: a review.,"Prophylactic neck dissection (PND) for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is controversial. Our aim was to assess current levels of evidence (LE) according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine ( http://www.cebm.net/?O=1025 ) regarding the oncologic benefits of PND. Data were analyzed via MEDLINE keywords: PTC, differentiated thyroid carcinoma, PND, central lymph node metastases, central compartment, recurrence-free survival. There was conflicting evidence regarding the rate of reoperation for recurrence, with some studies showing a lower rate after PND with increased recurrence-free survival and a higher rate of undetectable pre- and post-ablation thyroglobulin levels (LE 4), whereas other studies did not show a difference (LE 4). Only one study (LE 4) showed improved disease-specific survival with PND. PND may improve recurrence-free survival, although this is supported by only a low LE. Current recommendations can only be based on low-level evidence.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Findings from an international project.,"<h4>Background</h4>The 4-year (2007-2011) Revitalizing Health for All international research program (http://www.globalhealthequity.ca/projects/proj_revitalizing/index.shtml) supported 20 research teams located in 15 low- and middle-income countries to explore the strengths and weaknesses of comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) initiatives at their local or national levels. Teams were organized in a triad comprised of a senior researcher, a new researcher, and a 'research user' from government, health services, or other organizations with the authority or capacity to apply the research findings. Multiple regional and global team capacity-enhancement meetings were organized to refine methods and to discuss and assess cross-case findings.<h4>Objective</h4>Most research projects used mixed methods, incorporating analyses of qualitative data (interviews and focus groups), secondary data, and key policy and program documents. Some incorporated historical case study analyses, and a few undertook new surveys. The synthesis of findings in this report was derived through qualitative analysis of final project reports undertaken by three different reviewers.<h4>Results</h4>Evidence of comprehensiveness (defined in this research program as efforts to improve equity in access, community empowerment and participation, social and environmental health determinants, and intersectoral action) was found in many of the cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the important contextual differences amongst the different country studies, the similarity of many of their findings, often generated using mixed methods, attests to certain transferable health systems characteristics to create and sustain CPHC practices. These include:1. Well-trained and supported community health workers (CHWs) able to work effectively with marginalized communities2. Effective mechanisms for community participation, both informal (through participation in projects and programs, and meaningful consultation) and formal (though program management structures)3. Co-partnership models in program and policy development (in which financial and knowledge supports from governments or institutions are provided to communities, which retain decision-making powers in program design and implementation)4. Support for community advocacy and engagement in health and social systems decision makingThese characteristics, in turn, require a political context that supports state responsibilities for redistributive health and social protection measures.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25161233,TEMPI: probabilistic modeling time-evolving differential PPI networks with multiPle information.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Time-evolving differential protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are essential to understand serial activation of differentially regulated (up- or downregulated) cellular processes (DRPs) and their interplays over time. Despite developments in the network inference, current methods are still limited in identifying temporal transition of structures of PPI networks, DRPs associated with the structural transition and the interplays among the DRPs over time.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present a probabilistic model for estimating Time-Evolving differential PPI networks with MultiPle Information (TEMPI). This model describes probabilistic relationships among network structures, time-course gene expression data and Gene Ontology biological processes (GOBPs). By maximizing the likelihood of the probabilistic model, TEMPI estimates jointly the time-evolving differential PPI networks (TDNs) describing temporal transition of PPI network structures together with serial activation of DRPs associated with transiting networks. This joint estimation enables us to interpret the TDNs in terms of temporal transition of the DRPs. To demonstrate the utility of TEMPI, we applied it to two time-course datasets. TEMPI identified the TDNs that correctly delineated temporal transition of DRPs and time-dependent associations between the DRPs. These TDNs provide hypotheses for mechanisms underlying serial activation of key DRPs and their temporal associations.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code and sample data files are available at http://sbm.postech.ac.kr/tempi/sources.zip.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,sample data only

These 'production' settings will require enhanced quality monitoring and quality control to optimize output and reduce costs. We developed SeqControl, a framework for predicting sequencing quality and coverage using a set of 15 metrics describing overall coverage, coverage distribution, basewise coverage and basewise quality. Using whole-genome sequences of 27 prostate cancers and 26 normal references, we derived multivariate models that predict sequencing quality and depth. SeqControl robustly predicted how much sequencing was required to reach a given coverage depth (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.993), accurately classified clinically relevant formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, and made predictions from as little as one-eighth of a sequencing lane (AUC = 0.967).

25286919,Computing autocatalytic sets to unravel inconsistencies in metabolic network reconstructions.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have been established as a powerful tool for the prediction of cellular phenotypes and metabolic capabilities of organisms. In recent years, the number of network reconstructions has been constantly increasing, mostly because of the availability of novel (semi-)automated procedures, which enabled the reconstruction of metabolic models based on individual genomes and their annotation. The resulting models are widely used in numerous applications. However, the accuracy and predictive power of network reconstructions are commonly limited by inherent inconsistencies and gaps.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present a novel method to validate metabolic network reconstructions based on the concept of autocatalytic sets. Autocatalytic sets correspond to collections of metabolites that, besides enzymes and a growth medium, are required to produce all biomass components in a metabolic model. These autocatalytic sets are well-conserved across all domains of life, and their identification in specific genome-scale reconstructions allows us to draw conclusions about potential inconsistencies in these models. The method is capable of detecting inconsistencies, which are neglected by other gap-finding methods. We tested our method on the Model SEED, which is the largest repository for automatically generated genome-scale network reconstructions. In this way, we were able to identify a significant number of missing pathways in several of these reconstructions. Hence, the method we report represents a powerful tool to identify inconsistencies in large-scale metabolic networks.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The method is available as source code on http://users.minet.uni-jena.de/~m3kach/ASBIG/ASBIG.zip.<h4>Contact</h4>christoph.kaleta@uni-jena.de<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25329667,Accurate assignment of significance to neuropeptide identifications using Monte Carlo k-permuted decoy databases.,"In support of accurate neuropeptide identification in mass spectrometry experiments, novel Monte Carlo permutation testing was used to compute significance values. Testing was based on k-permuted decoy databases, where k denotes the number of permutations. These databases were integrated with a range of peptide identification indicators from three popular open-source database search software (OMSSA, Crux, and X! Tandem) to assess the statistical significance of neuropeptide spectra matches. Significance p-values were computed as the fraction of the sequences in the database with match indicator value better than or equal to the true target spectra. When applied to a test-bed of all known manually annotated mouse neuropeptides, permutation tests with k-permuted decoy databases identified up to 100% of the neuropeptides at p-value < 10(-5). The permutation test p-values using hyperscore (X! Tandem), E-value (OMSSA) and Sp score (Crux) match indicators outperformed all other match indicators. The robust performance to detect peptides of the intuitive indicator """"number of matched ions between the experimental and theoretical spectra"""" highlights the importance of considering this indicator when the p-value was borderline significant. Our findings suggest permutation decoy databases of size 1�105 are adequate to accurately detect neuropeptides and this can be exploited to increase the speed of the search. The straightforward Monte Carlo permutation testing (comparable to a zero order Markov model) can be easily combined with existing peptide identification software to enable accurate and effective neuropeptide detection.

25340248,"Head Injury: Triage, Assessment, Investigation and Early Management of Head Injury in Children, Young People and Adults","For the purposes of this guideline, head injury is defined as any trauma to the head other than superficial injuries to the face. Head injury is the commonest cause of death and disability in people aged 1�40 years in the UK. Data for head injury are recorded in the Hospital Episode Statistics (http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes). Each year, 1.4 million people attend emergency departments in England and Wales with a recent head injury. Between 33% and 50% of these are children aged under 15 years. Annually, about 200,000 people are admitted to hospital with head injury. Of these, one-fifth have features suggesting skull fracture or have evidence of brain damage. Most patients recover without specific or specialist intervention, but others experience long-term disability or even die from the effects of complications that could potentially be minimised or avoided with early detection and appropriate treatment. The incidence of death from head injury is low, with as few as 0.2% of all patients attending emergency departments with a head injury dying as a result of this injury. Ninety five per cent of people who have sustained a head injury present with a normal or minimally impaired conscious level (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] greater than 12) but the majority of fatal outcomes are in the moderate (GCS 9�12) or severe (GCS 8 or less) head injury groups, which account for only 5% of attenders. Therefore, emergency departments see a large number of patients with minor or mild head injuries and need to identify the very small number who will go on to have serious acute intracranial complications. It is estimated that 25�30% of children aged under 2 years who are hospitalised with head injury have an abusive head injury. This guideline has updated some of the terminology used in relation to safeguarding children and vulnerable adults. The previous head injury guideline produced by NICE in 2003 (NICE clinical guideline 4) and updated in 2007 (NICE clinical guideline 56) resulted in CT scanning replacing skull radiography as the primary imaging modality for assessing head injury. It also led to an increase in the proportion of people with severe head injury having their care managed in specialist centres. This has been associated with a decline in fatality among patients with severe head injury. This update is needed because of the continuing importance of up-to-date evidence-based guidance on the initial assessment and early management of head injury. Appropriate guidance can enable early detection and treatment of life-threatening brain injury, where present, but also early discharge of patients with negligible risk of brain injury. It can therefore save lives while at the same time preventing needless crowding in emergency departments and observation wards. Further key NHS changes have driven the scope of this update. These include the introduction in 2012 of regional trauma networks with major trauma triage tools within NHS England; the extension of indications for anticoagulation therapy; the expanding use of biomarkers to guide emergent clinical management in other conditions, such as chest pain; and the establishment of local safeguarding boards. The last of these addresses the requirement for front-line clinical staff to assess not only the severity of the head injury but also why it occurred.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,clinical
25341068,"Udock, the interactive docking entertainment system.","Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in biological processes. Protein docking calculations' goal is to predict, given two proteins of known structures, the associate conformation of the corresponding complex. Here, we present a new interactive protein docking system, Udock, that makes use of users' cognitive capabilities added up. In Udock, the users tackle simplified representations of protein structures and explore protein-protein interfaces' conformational space using a gamified interactive docking system with on the fly scoring. We assumed that if given appropriate tools, a na�ve user's cognitive capabilities could provide relevant data for (1) the prediction of correct interfaces in binary protein complexes and (2) the identification of the experimental partner in interaction among a set of decoys. To explore this approach experimentally, we conducted a preliminary two week long playtest where the registered users could perform a cross-docking on a dataset comprising 4 binary protein complexes. The users explored almost all the surface of the proteins that were available in the dataset but favored certain regions that seemed more attractive as potential docking spots. These favored regions were located inside or nearby the experimental binding interface for 5 out of the 8 proteins in the dataset. For most of them, the best scores were obtained with the experimental partner. The alpha version of Udock is freely accessible at http://udock.fr.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25344501,iDoComp: a compression scheme for assembled genomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the release of the latest next-generation sequencing (NGS) machine, the HiSeq X by Illumina, the cost of sequencing a Human has dropped to a mere $4000. Thus we are approaching a milestone in the sequencing history, known as the $1000 genome era, where the sequencing of individuals is affordable, opening the doors to effective personalized medicine. Massive generation of genomic data, including assembled genomes, is expected in the following years. There is crucial need for compression of genomes guaranteed of performing well simultaneously on different species, from simple bacteria to humans, which will ease their transmission, dissemination and analysis. Further, most of the new genomes to be compressed will correspond to individuals of a species from which a reference already exists on the database. Thus, it is natural to propose compression schemes that assume and exploit the availability of such references.<h4>Results</h4>We propose iDoComp, a compressor of assembled genomes presented in FASTA format that compresses an individual genome using a reference genome for both the compression and the decompression. In terms of compression efficiency, iDoComp outperforms previously proposed algorithms in most of the studied cases, with comparable or better running time. For example, we observe compression gains of up to 60% in several cases, including H.sapiens data, when comparing with the best compression performance among the previously proposed algorithms.<h4>Availability</h4>iDoComp is written in C and can be downloaded from: http://www.stanford.edu/~iochoa/iDoComp.html (We also provide a full explanation on how to run the program and an example with all the necessary files to run it.).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

25480679,Marky: a tool supporting annotation consistency in multi-user and iterative document annotation projects.,"<h4>Background and objectives</h4>Document annotation is a key task in the development of Text Mining methods and applications. High quality annotated corpora are invaluable, but their preparation requires a considerable amount of resources and time. Although the existing annotation tools offer good user interaction interfaces to domain experts, project management and quality control abilities are still limited. Therefore, the current work introduces Marky, a new Web-based document annotation tool equipped to manage multi-user and iterative projects, and to evaluate annotation quality throughout the project life cycle.<h4>Methods</h4>At the core, Marky is a Web application based on the open source CakePHP framework. User interface relies on HTML5 and CSS3 technologies. Rangy library assists in browser-independent implementation of common DOM range and selection tasks, and Ajax and JQuery technologies are used to enhance user-system interaction.<h4>Results</h4>Marky grants solid management of inter- and intra-annotator work. Most notably, its annotation tracking system supports systematic and on-demand agreement analysis and annotation amendment. Each annotator may work over documents as usual, but all the annotations made are saved by the tracking system and may be further compared. So, the project administrator is able to evaluate annotation consistency among annotators and across rounds of annotation, while annotators are able to reject or amend subsets of annotations made in previous rounds. As a side effect, the tracking system minimises resource and time consumption.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Marky is a novel environment for managing multi-user and iterative document annotation projects. Compared to other tools, Marky offers a similar visually intuitive annotation experience while providing unique means to minimise annotation effort and enforce annotation quality, and therefore corpus consistency.

However, the necessary harmonization of genetic datasets is currently error-prone because of many different file formats and lack of clarity about which genomic strand is used as reference.<h4>Findings</h4>Genotype Harmonizer (GH) is a command-line tool to harmonize genetic datasets by automatically solving issues concerning genomic strand and file format. GH solves the unknown strand issue by aligning ambiguous A/T and G/C SNPs to a specified reference, using linkage disequilibrium patterns without prior knowledge of the used strands. GH supports many common GWAS/NGS genotype formats including PLINK, binary PLINK, VCF, SHAPEIT2 & Oxford GEN. GH is implemented in Java and a large part of the functionality can also be used as Java 'Genotype-IO' API. All software is open source under license LGPLv3 and available from http://www.molgenis.org/systemsgenetics.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GH can be used to harmonize genetic datasets across different file formats and can be easily integrated as a step in routine meta-analysis and imputation pipelines.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25555998,Fiber estimation and tractography in diffusion MRI: development of simulated brain images and comparison of multi-fiber analysis methods at clinical b-values.,"Advances in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) have led to many alternative diffusion sampling strategies and analysis methodologies. A common objective among methods is estimation of white matter fiber orientations within each voxel, as doing so permits in-vivo fiber-tracking and the ability to study brain connectivity and networks. Knowledge of how DW-MRI sampling schemes affect fiber estimation accuracy, tractography and the ability to recover complex white-matter pathways, differences between results due to choice of analysis method, and which method(s) perform optimally for specific data sets, all remain important problems, especially as tractography-based studies become common. In this work, we begin to address these concerns by developing sets of simulated diffusion-weighted brain images which we then use to quantitatively evaluate the performance of six DW-MRI analysis methods in terms of estimated fiber orientation accuracy, false-positive (spurious) and false-negative (missing) fiber rates, and fiber-tracking. The analysis methods studied are: 1) a two-compartment """"ball and stick"""" model (BSM) (Behrens et al., 2003); 2) a non-negativity constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) approach (Tournier et al., 2007); 3) analytical q-ball imaging (QBI) (Descoteaux et al., 2007); 4) q-ball imaging with Funk-Radon and Cosine Transform (FRACT) (Haldar and Leahy, 2013); 5) q-ball imaging within constant solid angle (CSA) (Aganj et al., 2010); and 6) a generalized Fourier transform approach known as generalized q-sampling imaging (GQI) (Yeh et al., 2010). We investigate these methods using 20, 30, 40, 60, 90 and 120 evenly distributed q-space samples of a single shell, and focus on a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 18) and diffusion-weighting (b = 1000 s/mm(2)) common to clinical studies. We found that the BSM and CSD methods consistently yielded the least fiber orientation error and simultaneously greatest detection rate of fibers. Fiber detection rate was found to be the most distinguishing characteristic between the methods, and a significant factor for complete recovery of tractography through complex white-matter pathways. For example, while all methods recovered similar tractography of prominent white matter pathways of limited fiber crossing, CSD (which had the highest fiber detection rate, especially for voxels containing three fibers) recovered the greatest number of fibers and largest fraction of correct tractography for complex three-fiber crossing regions. The synthetic data sets, ground-truth, and tools for quantitative evaluation are publically available on the NITRC website as the project """"Simulated DW-MRI Brain Data Sets for Quantitative Evaluation of Estimated Fiber Orientations"""" at http://www.nitrc.org/projects/sim_dwi_brain.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced
25638814,Factor graph analysis of live cell-imaging data reveals mechanisms of cell fate decisions.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Cell fate decisions have a strong stochastic component. The identification of the underlying mechanisms therefore requires a rigorous statistical analysis of large ensembles of single cells that were tracked and phenotyped over time.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a probabilistic framework for testing elementary hypotheses on dynamic cell behavior using time-lapse cell-imaging data. Factor graphs, probabilistic graphical models, are used to properly account for cell lineage and cell phenotype information. Our model is applied to time-lapse movies of murine granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) cells. It decides between competing hypotheses on the mechanisms of their differentiation. Our results theoretically substantiate previous experimental observations that lineage instruction, not selection is the cause for the differentiation of GMP cells into mature monocytes or neutrophil granulocytes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The Matlab source code is available at http://treschgroup.de/Genealogies.html.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Scientists need access to the figures and the knowledge they represent in order to validate research findings and to generate new hypotheses. By themselves, these figures are nearly always incomprehensible to both humans and machines and their associated texts are therefore essential for full comprehension. The associated text of a figure, however, is scattered throughout its full-text article and contains redundant information content. In this paper, we report the continued development and evaluation of several figure summarization systems, the FigSum+ systems, that automatically identify associated texts, remove redundant information, and generate a text summary for every figure in an article. Using a set of 94 annotated figures selected from 19 different journals, we conducted an intrinsic evaluation of FigSum+. We evaluate the performance by precision, recall, F1, and ROUGE scores. The best FigSum+ system is based on an unsupervised method, achieving F1 score of 0.66 and ROUGE-1 score of 0.97.

25725497,IVA: accurate de novo assembly of RNA virus genomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>An accurate genome assembly from short read sequencing data is critical for downstream analysis, for example allowing investigation of variants within a sequenced population. However, assembling sequencing data from virus samples, especially RNA viruses, into a genome sequence is challenging due to the combination of viral population diversity and extremely uneven read depth caused by amplification bias in the inevitable reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification process of current methods.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a new de novo assembler called IVA (Iterative Virus Assembler) designed specifically for read pairs sequenced at highly variable depth from RNA virus samples. We tested IVA on datasets from 140 sequenced samples from human immunodeficiency virus-1 or influenza-virus-infected people and demonstrated that IVA outperforms all other virus de novo assemblers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software runs under Linux, has the GPLv3 licence and is freely available from http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/iva","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25765651,Analysis of strand-specific RNA-seq data using machine learning reveals the structures of transcription units in Clostridium thermocellum.,"Identification of transcription units (TUs) encoded in a bacterial genome is essential to elucidation of transcriptional regulation of the organism. To gain a detailed understanding of the dynamically composed TU structures, we have used four strand-specific RNA-seq (ssRNA-seq) datasets collected under two experimental conditions to derive the genomic TU organization of Clostridium thermocellum using a machine-learning approach. Our method accurately predicted the genomic boundaries of individual TUs based on two sets of parameters measuring the RNA-seq expression patterns across the genome: expression-level continuity and variance. A total of 2590 distinct TUs are predicted based on the four RNA-seq datasets. Among the predicted TUs, 44% have multiple genes. We assessed our prediction method on an independent set of RNA-seq data with longer reads. The evaluation confirmed the high quality of the predicted TUs. Functional enrichment analyses on a selected subset of the predicted TUs revealed interesting biology. To demonstrate the generality of the prediction method, we have also applied the method to RNA-seq data collected on Escherichia coli and achieved high prediction accuracies. The TU prediction program named SeqTU is publicly available at https://code.google.com/p/seqtu/. We expect that the predicted TUs can serve as the baseline information for studying transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in C. thermocellum and other bacteria.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The co-expression patterns of DSCR genes in brain were calculated by using multivariate statistical methods.<h4>Results</h4>Highest levels of gene expression were registered at caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens and putamen among central areas of cerebral cortex. Increased expression levels of RCAN1 that encode by a protein involved in signal transduction process of the CNS were recorded for PCP4 that participates in the binding to calmodulin and TTC3; a protein that is associated with differentiation of neurons. That previously identified brain structures play a crucial role in the learning process, in different class of memory and in motor skills.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The precise regulation of DSCR gene expression is crucial to maintain the brain homeostasis, especially in those areas with high levels of gene expression associated with a remarkable process of learning and cognition.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource

It provides instantaneous processing of the 3-D movement coordinates of up to 20 markers at a single instant. Available functions include (1) the setting of reference positions, areas, and trajectories of interest; (2) recording of the 3-D coordinates for each marker over the trial duration; and (3) the detection of events to use as triggers for external reinforcers (e.g., lights, sounds, or odors).

25833981,Community-based management of severe acute malnutrition in India: new evidence from Bihar.,"<h4>Background</h4>An estimated one-third of the world's children who are wasted live in India. In Bihar state, of children <5 y old, 27.1% are wasted and 8.3% have severe acute malnutrition (SAM). In 2009, M�decins Sans Fronti�res (MSF) initiated a community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) program for children aged 6-59 mo with SAM.<h4>Objective</h4>In this report, we describe the characteristics and outcomes of 8274 children treated between February 2009 and September 2011.<h4>Design</h4>Between February 2009 and June 2010, the program admitted children with a weight-for-height z score (WHZ) <-3 SD and/or midupper arm circumference (MUAC) <110 mm and discharged those who reached a WHZ >-2 SDs and MUAC >110 mm. These variables changed in July 2010 to admission on the basis of an MUAC <115 mm and discharge at an MUAC =120 mm. Uncomplicated SAM cases were treated as outpatients in the community by using a WHO-standard, ready-to-use, therapeutic lipid-based paste produced in India; complicated cases were treated as inpatients by using F75/F100 WHO-standard milk until they could complete treatment in the community.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 8274 children were admitted including 5149 girls (62.2%), 6613 children aged 6-23 mo (79.9%), and 87.3% children who belonged to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, or Other Backward Caste families or households. Of 3873 children admitted under the old criteria, 41 children (1.1%) died, 2069 children (53.4%) were discharged as cured, and 1485 children (38.3%) defaulted. Of 4401 children admitted under the new criteria, 36 children (0.8%) died, 2526 children (57.4%) were discharged as cured, and 1591 children (36.2%) defaulted. For children discharged as cured, the mean (�SD) weight gain and length of stay were 4.7 � 3.1 and 5.1 � 3.7 g � kg(-1) � d(-1) and 8.7 � 6.1 and 7.3 � 5.6 wk under the old and new criteria, respectively (P < 0.01). After adjustment, significant risk factors for default were as follows: no community referral for admission, more severe wasting on admission, younger age, and a long commute for treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To our knowledge, this is the first conventional CMAM program in India and has achieved low mortality and high cure rates in nondefaulting children. The new admission criteria lower the threshold for severity with the result that more children are included who are at lower risk of death and have a smaller WHZ deficit to correct than do children identified by the old criteria.

25837579,Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenetic Inference with Selection on Protein Folding Stability.,"Despite intense work, incorporating constraints on protein native structures into the mathematical models of molecular evolution remains difficult, because most models and programs assume that protein sites evolve independently, whereas protein stability is maintained by interactions between sites. Here, we address this problem by developing a new mean-field substitution model that generates independent site-specific amino acid distributions with constraints on the stability of the native state against both unfolding and misfolding. The model depends on a background distribution of amino acids and one selection parameter that we fix maximizing the likelihood of the observed protein sequence. The analytic solution of the model shows that the main determinant of the site-specific distributions is the number of native contacts of the site and that the most variable sites are those with an intermediate number of native contacts. The mean-field models obtained, taking into account misfolded conformations, yield larger likelihood than models that only consider the native state, because their average hydrophobicity is more realistic, and they produce on the average stable sequences for most proteins. We evaluated the mean-field model with respect to empirical substitution models on 12 test data sets of different protein families. In all cases, the observed site-specific sequence profiles presented smaller Kullback-Leibler divergence from the mean-field distributions than from the empirical substitution model. Next, we obtained substitution rates combining the mean-field frequencies with an empirical substitution model. The resulting mean-field substitution model assigns larger likelihood than the empirical model to all studied families when we consider sequences with identity larger than 0.35, plausibly a condition that enforces conservation of the native structure across the family. We found that the mean-field model performs better than other structurally constrained models with similar or higher complexity. With respect to the much more complex model recently developed by Bordner and Mittelmann, which takes into account pairwise terms in the amino acid distributions and also optimizes the exchangeability matrix, our model performed worse for data with small sequence divergence but better for data with larger sequence divergence. The mean-field model has been implemented into the computer program Prot_Evol that is freely available at http://ub.cbm.uam.es/software/Prot_Evol.php.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25855375,Alterations of Functional Connectivity Among Resting-State Networks in Hypothyroidism.,"Hypothyroidism affects brain functioning as suggested by various neuroimaging studies. The primary focus of the present study was to examine whether hypothyroidism would impact connectivity among resting-state networks (RSNs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Twenty-two patients with hypothyroidism and 22 healthy controls were recruited and scanned using rsfMRI. The data were analysed using independent component analysis and a dual regression approach that was applied on five RSNs that were identified using fsl software (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk). Hypothyroid patients showed significantly decreased functional connectivity in the regions of the right frontoparietal network (frontal pole), the medial visual network (lateral occipital gyrus, precuneus cortex and cuneus) and the motor network (precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, precuneus cortex, paracingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus and supramarginal gyrus) compared to healthy controls. The reduced functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, the medial visual network and the motor network suggests neurocognitive alterations in hypothyroid patients in the corresponding functions. However, the study would be further continued to investigate the effects of thyroxine treatment and correlation with neurocognitive scores. The findings of the present study provide further interesting insights into our understanding of the action of thyroid hormone on the adult human brain.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25855811,SANSparallel: interactive homology search against Uniprot.,"Proteins evolve by mutations and natural selection. The network of sequence similarities is a rich source for mining homologous relationships that inform on protein structure and function. There are many servers available to browse the network of homology relationships but one has to wait up to a minute for results. The SANSparallel webserver provides protein sequence database searches with immediate response and professional alignment visualization by third-party software. The output is a list, pairwise alignment or stacked alignment of sequence-similar proteins from Uniprot, UniRef90/50, Swissprot or Protein Data Bank. The stacked alignments are viewed in Jalview or as sequence logos. The database search uses the suffix array neighborhood search (SANS) method, which has been re-implemented as a client-server, improved and parallelized. The method is extremely fast and as sensitive as BLAST above 50% sequence identity. Benchmarks show that the method is highly competitive compared to previously published fast database search programs: UBLAST, DIAMOND, LAST, LAMBDA, RAPSEARCH2 and BLAT. The web server can be accessed interactively or programmatically at http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/cgi-bin/sans/sans.cgi. It can be used to make protein functional annotation pipelines more efficient, and it is useful in interactive exploration of the detailed evidence supporting the annotation of particular proteins of interest.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25886978,Accurate prediction of RNA nucleotide interactions with backbone k-tree model.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Given the importance of non-coding RNAs to cellular regulatory functions, it would be highly desirable to have accurate computational prediction of RNA 3D structure, a task which remains challenging. Even for a short RNA sequence, the space of tertiary conformations is immense; existing methods to identify native-like conformations mostly resort to random sampling of conformations to achieve computational feasibility. However, native conformations may not be examined and prediction accuracy may be compromised due to sampling. State-of-the-art methods have yet to deliver satisfactory predictions for RNAs of length beyond 50 nucleotides.<h4>Results</h4>This paper presents a method to tackle a key step in the RNA 3D structure prediction problem, the prediction of the nucleotide interactions that constitute the desired 3D structure. The research is based on a novel graph model, called a backbone k-tree, to tightly constrain the nucleotide interaction relationships considered for RNA 3D structures. It is shown that the new model makes it possible to efficiently predict the optimal set of nucleotide interactions (including the non-canonical interactions in all recently revealed families) from the query sequence along with known or predicted canonical basepairs. The preliminary results indicate that in most cases the new method can predict with a high accuracy the nucleotide interactions that constitute the 3D structure of the query sequence. It thus provides a useful tool for the accurate prediction of RNA 3D structure.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The source package for BkTree is available at http://rna-informatics.uga.edu/index.php?f=software&p=BkTree.<h4>Contact</h4>lding@uga.edu or cai@cs.uga.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Therefore, a variant calling algorithm for calling low-frequency polymorphisms in heterogeneous samples is needed.<h4>Results</h4>We present a novel variant calling algorithm that uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate allele frequency and call variants in heterogeneous samples. We show that our algorithm improves upon current classifiers and has higher sensitivity and specificity over a wide range of median read depth and minor allele fraction.

25952609,Heterozygous genome assembly via binary classification of homologous sequence.,"<h4>Background</h4>Genome assemblers to date have predominantly targeted haploid reference reconstruction from homozygous data. When applied to diploid genome assembly, these assemblers perform poorly, owing to the violation of assumptions during both the contigging and scaffolding phases. Effective tools to overcome these problems are in growing demand. Increasing parameter stringency during contigging is an effective solution to obtaining haplotype-specific contigs; however, effective algorithms for scaffolding such contigs are lacking.<h4>Methods</h4>We present a stand-alone scaffolding algorithm, ScaffoldScaffolder, designed specifically for scaffolding diploid genomes. The algorithm identifies homologous sequences as found in """"bubble"""" structures in scaffold graphs. Machine learning classification is used to then classify sequences in partial bubbles as homologous or non-homologous sequences prior to reconstructing haplotype-specific scaffolds. We define four new metrics for assessing diploid scaffolding accuracy: contig sequencing depth, contig homogeneity, phase group homogeneity, and heterogeneity between phase groups.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate the viability of using bubbles to identify heterozygous homologous contigs, which we term homolotigs. We show that machine learning classification trained on these homolotig pairs can be used effectively for identifying homologous sequences elsewhere in the data with high precision (assuming error-free reads).<h4>Conclusion</h4>More work is required to comparatively analyze this approach on real data with various parameters and classifiers against other diploid genome assembly methods. However, the initial results of ScaffoldScaffolder supply validity to the idea of employing machine learning in the difficult task of diploid genome assembly.

Collaboration with environmental health science through team projects has advanced and improved our understanding of environmental health and justice.<h4>Objective</h4>We sought to identify diverse methods and topics in which social scientists have expanded environmental health understandings at multiple levels, to examine how transdisciplinary environmental health research fosters better science, and to learn how these partnerships have been able to flourish because of the support from National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS).<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed various types of social science research to investigate how social science contributes to environmental health. We also examined NIEHS programs that foster social science. In addition, we developed a case study of a community-based participation research project in Akwesasne in order to demonstrate how social science has enhanced environmental health science.<h4>Results</h4>Social science has informed environmental health science through ethnographic studies of contaminated communities, analysis of spatial distribution of environmental injustice, psychological experience of contamination, social construction of risk and risk perception, and social impacts of disasters. Social science-environmental health team science has altered the way scientists traditionally explore exposure by pressing for cumulative exposure approaches and providing research data for policy applications.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A transdisciplinary approach for environmental health practice has emerged that engages the social sciences to paint a full picture of the consequences of contamination so that policy makers, regulators, public health officials, and other stakeholders can better ameliorate impacts and prevent future exposure.<h4>Citation</h4>Hoover E, Renauld M, Edelstein MR, Brown P. 2015.

This view is not easily obtained: it requires the integration of context-specific protein list or expression data with up-to-date data of protein interactions that are typically spread across multiple databases. The MyProteinNet web server allows users to easily create such context-sensitive protein interaction networks. Users can automatically gather and consolidate data from up to 11 different databases to create a generic protein interaction network (interactome). They can score the interactions based on reliability and filter them by user-defined contexts including molecular expression and protein annotation. The output of MyProteinNet includes the generic and filtered interactome files, together with a summary of their network attributes. MyProteinNet is particularly geared toward building human tissue interactomes, by maintaining tissue expression profiles from multiple resources. The ability of MyProteinNet to facilitate the construction of up-to-date, context-specific interactomes and its applicability to 11 different organisms and to tens of human tissues, make it a powerful tool in meaningful analysis of protein networks.

Various data processing methods have been developed for exploring the resultant high volume data. However, most of these methods process data in the spectral domain and do not make the most of the important spatial information available through this technology. Therefore, we propose a novel streamlined data analysis pipeline specifically developed for MALDI-IMS data utilizing significant spatial information for identifying hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in these complex datasets.<h4>Methods</h4>The proposed unsupervised algorithm uses Sliding Window Normalization (SWN) and a new spatial distribution based peak picking method developed based on Gray level Co-Occurrence (GCO) matrices followed by clustering of biomolecules. We also use gist descriptors and an improved version of GCO matrices to extract features from molecular images and minimum medoid distance to automatically estimate the number of possible groups.<h4>Results</h4>We evaluated our algorithm using a new MALDI-IMS metabolomics dataset of a plant (Eucalypt) leaf. The algorithm revealed hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in the dataset, which the current Component Analysis and Segmentation Map based approaches failed to extract. We further demonstrate the performance of our peak picking method over other traditional approaches by using a publicly available MALDI-IMS proteomics dataset of a rat brain. Although SWN did not show any significant improvement as compared with using no normalization, the visual assessment showed an improvement as compared to using the median normalization.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The source code and sample data are freely available at http://exims.sourceforge.net/.<h4>Contact</h4>awgcdw@student.unimelb.edu.au or chalini_w@live.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The two current approaches to the analysis of antibody repertoires [next generation sequencing (NGS) and mass spectrometry (MS)] present difficult computational challenges since antibodies are not directly encoded in the germline but are extensively diversified by somatic recombination and hypermutations. Therefore, the protein database required for the interpretation of spectra from circulating antibodies is custom for each individual. Although such a database can be constructed via NGS, the reads generated by NGS are error-prone and even a single nucleotide error precludes identification of a peptide by the standard proteomics tools. Here, we present the IgRepertoireConstructor algorithm that performs error-correction of immunosequencing reads and uses mass spectra to validate the constructed antibody repertoires.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>IgRepertoireConstructor is open source and freely available as a C++ and Python program running on all Unix-compatible platforms.

The resulting AncesTree algorithm is better able to identify ancestral relationships between individual mutations than existing approaches, particularly in ultra-deep sequencing data when high read counts for mutations yield high confidence VAFs.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>An implementation of AncesTree is available at: http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/software.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26072515,Inferring orthologous gene regulatory networks using interspecies data fusion.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The ability to jointly learn gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in, or leverage GRNs between related species would allow the vast amount of legacy data obtained in model organisms to inform the GRNs of more complex, or economically or medically relevant counterparts. Examples include transferring information from Arabidopsis thaliana into related crop species for food security purposes, or from mice into humans for medical applications. Here we develop two related Bayesian approaches to network inference that allow GRNs to be jointly inferred in, or leveraged between, several related species: in one framework, network information is directly propagated between species; in the second hierarchical approach, network information is propagated via an unobserved 'hypernetwork'. In both frameworks, information about network similarity is captured via graph kernels, with the networks additionally informed by species-specific time series gene expression data, when available, using Gaussian processes to model the dynamics of gene expression.<h4>Results</h4>Results on in silico benchmarks demonstrate that joint inference, and leveraging of known networks between species, offers better accuracy than standalone inference. The direct propagation of network information via the non-hierarchical framework is more appropriate when there are relatively few species, while the hierarchical approach is better suited when there are many species. Both methods are robust to small amounts of mislabelling of orthologues. Finally, the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae data and networks to inform inference of networks in the budding yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe predicts a novel role in cell cycle regulation for Gas1 (SPAC19B12.02c), a 1,3-beta-glucanosyltransferase.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>MATLAB code is available from http://go.warwick.ac.uk/systemsbiology/software/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Mitochondrial genomes have been widely used to evaluate relationships between species in several fields, including evolutionary and population genetics, as well as in forensic identification and in the study of mitochondrial diseases in humans. However, the creation of mitochondrial genomes is extremely time consuming. In this paper, we present a new tool, MITOSCISSOR, which is a rapid method for parsing and formatting dozens of complete mitochondrial genome sequences. With the aid of MITOSCISSOR, complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 103 species from Tetraodontiformes (a difficult-to-classify order of fish) were easily parsed and formatted. It typically takes several days to produce similar results when relying upon manual editing. This tool could open the .gb file of Genbank directly and help us to use existing mitogenomic data. In the present study, we established the first clear and robust molecular phylogeny of 103 tetraodontiform fishes, a goal that has long eluded ichthyologists.

26130741,Cohort Profile Update: Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health.,"In 1996 the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health recruited a nationally representative sample of more than 40,000 women in three age cohorts, born in 1973-78, 1946-51 and 1921-26. At least six waves of 3-yearly surveys have been completed. Although the focus remains on factors affecting the health and well-being of women and their access to and use of health services across urban, rural and remote areas of Australia, the study has now been considerably expanded by linkage to other health data sets. For most women who have ever participated in the study, linked records are now available for: government-subsidized non-hospital services (e.g. all general practitioner visits); pharmaceutical prescriptions filled; national death index, including codes for multiple causes of death; aged care assessments and services; cancer registries; and, for most states and territories, hospital admissions and perinatal data. Additionally, a large cohort of women born in 1989-95 have been recruited. The data are available to approved collaborators, with more than 780 researchers using the data so far.

As quality assessment assumes prior knowledge on species phylogenies, we investigated the congruency between existing species trees by comparing the relationships of 147 QfO reference organisms from six Tree of Life (ToL)/species tree projects: The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy, Opentree of Life, the sequenced species/species ToL, the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) database, and trees published by Ciccarelli et al. (Ciccarelli FD, et al. 2006. Toward automatic reconstruction of a highly resolved tree of life. Science 311:1283-1287) and by Huerta-Cepas et al. (Huerta-Cepas J, Marcet-Houben M, Gabaldon T. 2014. A nested phylogenetic reconstruction approach provides scalable resolution in the eukaryotic Tree Of Life. PeerJ PrePrints 2:223) Our study reveals that each species tree suggests a different phylogeny: 87 of the 146 (60%) possible splits of a dichotomous and rooted tree are congruent, while all other splits are incongruent in at least one of the species trees. Topological differences are observed not only at deep speciation events, but also within younger clades, such as Hominidae, Rodentia, Laurasiatheria, or rosids. The evolutionary relationships of 27 archaea and bacteria are highly inconsistent. By assessing 458,108 gene trees from 65 genomes, we show that consistent species topologies are more often supported by gene phylogenies than contradicting ones. The largest concordant species tree includes 77 of the QfO reference organisms at the most. Results are summarized in the form of a consensus ToL (http://swisstree.vital-it.ch/species_tree) that can serve different benchmarking purposes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,summmaried data
26150785,The PREP pipeline: standardized preprocessing for large-scale EEG analysis.,"The technology to collect brain imaging and physiological measures has become portable and ubiquitous, opening the possibility of large-scale analysis of real-world human imaging. By its nature, such data is large and complex, making automated processing essential. This paper shows how lack of attention to the very early stages of an EEG preprocessing pipeline can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and introduce unwanted artifacts into the data, particularly for computations done in single precision. We demonstrate that ordinary average referencing improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but that noisy channels can contaminate the results. We also show that identification of noisy channels depends on the reference and examine the complex interaction of filtering, noisy channel identification, and referencing. We introduce a multi-stage robust referencing scheme to deal with the noisy channel-reference interaction. We propose a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline (PREP) and discuss the application of the pipeline to more than 600 EEG datasets. The pipeline includes an automatically generated report for each dataset processed. Users can download the PREP pipeline as a freely available MATLAB library from http://eegstudy.org/prepcode.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26226130,Node sampling for protein complex estimation in bait-prey graphs.,"In cellular biology, node-and-edge graph or """"network"""" data collection often uses bait-prey technologies such as co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP). Bait-prey technologies assay relationships or """"interactions"""" between protein pairs, with CoIP specifically measuring protein complex co-membership. Analyses of CoIP data frequently focus on estimating protein complex membership. Due to budgetary and other constraints, exhaustive assay of the entire network using CoIP is not always possible. We describe a stratified sampling scheme to select baits for CoIP experiments when protein complex estimation is the main goal. Expanding upon the classic framework in which nodes represent proteins and edges represent pairwise interactions, we define generalized nodes as sets of adjacent nodes with identical adjacency outside the set and use these as strata from which to select the next set of baits. Strata are redefined at each round of sampling to incorporate accumulating data. This scheme maintains user-specified quality thresholds for protein complex estimates and, relative to simple random sampling, leads to a marked increase in the number of correctly estimated complexes at each round of sampling.

As data collection is increasingly streamlined and ubiquitous, data exploration, discovery and analytics get considerably harder. Exploratory querying of heterogeneous and multi-source information is both difficult and necessary to advance our knowledge about the world around us.<h4>Research design</h4>We developed a mechanism to integrate dispersed multi-source data and service the mashed information via human and machine interfaces in a secure, scalable manner. This process facilitates the exploration of subtle associations between variables, population strata, or clusters of data elements, which may be opaque to standard independent inspection of the individual sources. This a new platform includes a device agnostic tool (Dashboard webapp, http://socr.umich.edu/HTML5/Dashboard/) for graphical querying, navigating and exploring the multivariate associations in complex heterogeneous datasets.<h4>Results</h4>The paper illustrates this core functionality and serviceoriented infrastructure using healthcare data (e.g., US data from the 2010 Census, Demographic and Economic surveys, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Center for Medicare Services) as well as Parkinson's Disease neuroimaging data. Both the back-end data archive and the front-end dashboard interfaces are continuously expanded to include additional data elements and new ways to customize the human and machine interactions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A client-side data import utility allows for easy and intuitive integration of user-supplied datasets. This completely open-science framework may be used for exploratory analytics, confirmatory analyses, meta-analyses, and education and training purposes in a wide variety of fields.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,out of scope
26271256,DeDaL: Cytoscape 3 app for producing and morphing data-driven and structure-driven network layouts.,"<h4>Background</h4>Visualization and analysis of molecular profiling data together with biological networks are able to provide new mechanistic insights into biological functions. Currently, it is possible to visualize high-throughput data on top of pre-defined network layouts, but they are not always adapted to a given data analysis task. A network layout based simultaneously on the network structure and the associated multidimensional data might be advantageous for data visualization and analysis in some cases.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a Cytoscape app, which allows constructing biological network layouts based on the data from molecular profiles imported as values of node attributes. DeDaL is a Cytoscape 3 app, which uses linear and non-linear algorithms of dimension reduction to produce data-driven network layouts based on multidimensional data (typically gene expression). DeDaL implements several data pre-processing and layout post-processing steps such as continuous morphing between two arbitrary network layouts and aligning one network layout with respect to another one by rotating and mirroring. The combination of all these functionalities facilitates the creation of insightful network layouts representing both structural network features and correlation patterns in multivariate data. We demonstrate the added value of applying DeDaL in several practical applications, including an example of a large protein-protein interaction network.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DeDaL is a convenient tool for applying data dimensionality reduction methods and for designing insightful data displays based on data-driven layouts of biological networks, built within Cytoscape environment.

Marker genes are of great importance for determining cell identity, and for understanding tissue specific gene function and the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a new bioinformatics tool called MGFM (Marker Gene Finder in Microarray data) to predict marker genes from microarray gene expression data. Marker genes are identified through the grouping of samples of the same type with similar marker gene expression levels. We verified our approach using two microarray data sets from the NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus public repository encompassing samples for similar sets of five human tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, and lung). Comparison with another tool for tissue-specific gene identification and validation with literature-derived established tissue markers established functionality, accuracy and simplicity of our tool. Furthermore, top ranked marker genes were experimentally validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The sets of predicted marker genes associated with the five selected tissues comprised well-known genes of particular importance in these tissues. The tool is freely available from the Bioconductor web site, and it is also provided as an online application integrated into the CellFinder platform ( http://cellfinder.org/analysis/marker ).<h4>Conclusions</h4>MGFM is a useful tool to predict tissue/cell type marker genes using microarray gene expression data. The implementation of the tool as an R-package as well as an application within CellFinder facilitates its use.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26318525,[MEG]PLS: A pipeline for MEG data analysis and partial least squares statistics.,"The emphasis of modern neurobiological theories has recently shifted from the independent function of brain areas to their interactions in the context of whole-brain networks. As a result, neuroimaging methods and analyses have also increasingly focused on network discovery. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging modality that captures neural activity with a high degree of temporal specificity, providing detailed, time varying maps of neural activity. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis is a multivariate framework that can be used to isolate distributed spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity that differentiate groups or cognitive tasks, to relate neural activity to behavior, and to capture large-scale network interactions. Here we introduce [MEG]PLS, a MATLAB-based platform that streamlines MEG data preprocessing, source reconstruction and PLS analysis in a single unified framework. [MEG]PLS facilitates MRI preprocessing, including segmentation and coregistration, MEG preprocessing, including filtering, epoching, and artifact correction, MEG sensor analysis, in both time and frequency domains, MEG source analysis, including multiple head models and beamforming algorithms, and combines these with a suite of PLS analyses. The pipeline is open-source and modular, utilizing functions from FieldTrip (Donders, NL), AFNI (NIMH, USA), SPM8 (UCL, UK) and PLScmd (Baycrest, CAN), which are extensively supported and continually developed by their respective communities. [MEG]PLS is flexible, providing both a graphical user interface and command-line options, depending on the needs of the user. A visualization suite allows multiple types of data and analyses to be displayed and includes 4-D montage functionality.

26353840,Reveel: large-scale population genotyping using low-coverage sequencing data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Population low-coverage whole-genome sequencing is rapidly emerging as a prominent approach for discovering genomic variation and genotyping a cohort. This approach combines substantially lower cost than full-coverage sequencing with whole-genome discovery of low-allele frequency variants, to an extent that is not possible with array genotyping or exome sequencing. However, a challenging computational problem arises of jointly discovering variants and genotyping the entire cohort. Variant discovery and genotyping are relatively straightforward tasks on a single individual that has been sequenced at high coverage, because the inference decomposes into the independent genotyping of each genomic position for which a sufficient number of confidently mapped reads are available. However, in low-coverage population sequencing, the joint inference requires leveraging the complex linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in the cohort to compensate for sparse and missing data in each individual. The potentially massive computation time for such inference, as well as the missing data that confound low-frequency allele discovery, need to be overcome for this approach to become practical.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present Reveel, a novel method for single nucleotide variant calling and genotyping of large cohorts that have been sequenced at low coverage. Reveel introduces a novel technique for leveraging LD that deviates from previous Markov-based models, and which is aimed at computational efficiency as well as accuracy in capturing LD patterns present in rare haplotypes. We evaluate Reveel's performance through extensive simulations as well as real data from the 1000 Genomes Project, and show that it achieves higher accuracy in low-frequency allele discovery and substantially lower computation cost than previous state-of-the-art methods.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://reveel.stanford.edu/<h4>Contact</h4>: serafim@cs.stanford.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26394400,Validation of the RRE-90 Scale to Predict Stroke Risk after Transient Symptoms with Infarction: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>The risk of stroke after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) for patients with a positive diffusion-weighted image (DWI), i.e., transient symptoms with infarction (TSI), is much higher than for those with a negative DWI. The aim of this study was to validate the predictive value of a web-based recurrence risk estimator (RRE; http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/RRE/) of TSI.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from the prospective hospital-based TIA database of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were analyzed. The RRE and ABCD2 scores were calculated within 7 days of symptom onset. The predictive outcome was ischemic stroke occurrence at 90 days. The receiver-operating characteristics curves were plotted, and the predictive value of the two models was assessed by computing the C statistics.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 221 eligible patients were prospectively enrolled, of whom 46 (20.81%) experienced a stroke within 90 days. The 90-day stroke risk in high-risk TSI patients (RRE =4) was 3.406-fold greater than in those at low risk (P <0.001). The C statistic of RRE (0.681; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.592-0.771) was statistically higher than that of ABCD2 score (0.546; 95% CI, 0.454-0.638; Z = 2.115; P = 0.0344) at 90 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The RRE score had a higher predictive value than the ABCD2 score for assessing the 90-day risk of stroke after TSI.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26395772,APTANI: a computational tool to select aptamers through sequence-structure motif analysis of HT-SELEX data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Aptamers are synthetic nucleic acid molecules that can bind biological targets in virtue of both their sequence and three-dimensional structure. Aptamers are selected using SELEX, Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment, a technique that exploits aptamer-target binding affinity. The SELEX procedure, coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HT-SELEX), creates billions of random sequences capable of binding different epitopes on specific targets. Since this technique produces enormous amounts of data, computational analysis represents a critical step to screen and select the most biologically relevant sequences.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present APTANI, a computational tool to identify target-specific aptamers from HT-SELEX data and secondary structure information. APTANI builds on AptaMotif algorithm, originally implemented to analyze SELEX data; extends the applicability of AptaMotif to HT-SELEX data and introduces new functionalities, as the possibility to identify binding motifs, to cluster aptamer families or to compare output results from different HT-SELEX cycles. Tabular and graphical representations facilitate the downstream biological interpretation of results.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>APTANI is available at http://aptani.unimore.it.<h4>Contact</h4>silvio.bicciato@unimore.it<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26398339,Small Supernumerary Marker Chromosomes in Human Infertility.,"Small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) are structurally abnormal chromosomes that cannot be unambiguously identified by banding cytogenetics. The objective of this study was to provide an overview of sSMC frequency and characterization in a context of infertility and to review the literature describing sSMC in relation with male and female infertility. Therefore, a systematic literature review on sSMC associated with infertility was conducted by means of a PubMed literature and a sSMC database (http://ssmc-tl.com/sSMC.html) search. A total of 234 patients with infertility were identified as carriers of sSMC. All chromosomes, except chromosomes 10, 19 and the X, were involved in sSMC, and in 72% the sSMC originated from acrocentric chromosomes. Euchromatic imbalances were caused by the presence of sSMC in 30% of the cases. Putative genes have been identified in only 1.2% of sSMC associated with infertility. The implication of sSMC in infertility could be due to a partial trisomy of some genes but also to mechanical effects perturbing meiosis. Further precise molecular and interphase-architecture studies on sSMC are needed in the future to characterize the relationship between this chromosomal anomaly and human infertility.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26435838,Improving preparedness of medical students and junior doctors to manage patients with diabetes.,"<h4>Objective</h4>New medical graduates are the front-line staff in many hospital settings and manage patients with diabetes frequently. Prescribing is an area of concern for junior doctors, however, with insulin prescribing reported as a particular weakness. This study aimed to produce an educational intervention which aimed to improve preparedness to manage patients with diabetes and evaluate it using a mixed methods approach.<h4>Research design and methods</h4>An e-resource (http://www.diabetesscenariosforjuniordoctors.co.uk) was created to contain commonplace and authentic diabetes decision-making scenarios. -32 junior doctors (n=20) and year 5 students (n=12) in South West England worked through the scenarios while 'thinking aloud' and then undertook a semistructured interview. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. Participant confidence to manage patients with diabetes before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after the educational intervention was also measured using a self-rating scale.<h4>Results</h4>Participants reported that patients with diabetes were daunting to manage because of the wide array of insulin products, their lack of confidence with chronic disease management and the difficulty of applying theory to practice. The e-resource was described as authentic, practical, and appropriate for the target audience. Junior doctors' self-rated confidence to manage patients with diabetes increased from 4.7 (of 10) before using the e-resource, to 6.4 immediately afterwards, and 6.8 6 weeks later. Medical students' confidence increased from 5.1 before, to 6.4 immediately afterwards, and 6.4 6 weeks later.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Providing opportunities to work with authentic scenarios in a safe environment can help to ameliorate junior doctors' lack of confidence to manage patients with diabetes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,clinical

26477251,Spin labeling and Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) to Deconstruct Conformational Ensembles of HIV Protease.,"An understanding of macromolecular conformational equilibrium in biological systems is oftentimes essential to understand function, dysfunction, and disease. For the past few years, our lab has been utilizing site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, to characterize the conformational ensemble and ligand-induced conformational shifts of HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR). The biomedical importance of characterizing the fractional occupancy of states within the conformational ensemble critically impacts our hypothesis of a conformational selection mechanism of drug-resistance evolution in HIV-1PR. The purpose of the following chapter is to give a timeline perspective of our SDSL EPR approach to characterizing conformational sampling of HIV-1PR. We provide detailed instructions for the procedure utilized in analyzing distance profiles for HIV-1PR obtained from pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR). Specifically, we employ a version of PELDOR known as double electron-electron resonance (DEER). Data are processed with the software package """"DeerAnalysis"""" (http://www.epr.ethz.ch/software), which implements Tikhonov regularization (TKR), to generate a distance profile from electron spin-echo amplitude modulations. We assign meaning to resultant distance profiles based upon a conformational sampling model, which is described herein. The TKR distance profiles are reconstructed with a linear combination of Gaussian functions, which is then statistically analyzed. In general, DEER has proven powerful for observing structural ensembles in proteins and, more recently, nucleic acids. Our goal is to present our advances in order to aid readers in similar applications.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

While their role in cardiac disease is only starting to be understood, their involvement in cardiac hypertrophy is poorly known. We studied the association between lncRNAs and left ventricular hypertrophy using whole transcriptome microarrays. Wild-type mice and mice overexpressing the adenosine A2A receptor were subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce left ventricular hypertrophy. Expression profiles of lncRNAs in the heart were characterized using genome-wide microarrays. An analytical pipeline was specifically developed to extract lncRNA data from microarrays. We identified 2 lncRNAs up-regulated and 3 lncRNAs down-regulated in the hearts of A2A-receptor overexpressing-mice subjected to TAC compared to wild-type mice. Differential expression of these 2 lncRNAs was validated by quantitative PCR.

26537179,BRANE Cut: biologically-related a priori network enhancement with graph cuts for gene regulatory network inference.,"<h4>Background</h4>Inferring gene networks from high-throughput data constitutes an important step in the discovery of relevant regulatory relationships in organism cells. Despite the large number of available Gene Regulatory Network inference methods, the problem remains challenging: the underdetermination in the space of possible solutions requires additional constraints that incorporate a priori information on gene interactions.<h4>Methods</h4>Weighting all possible pairwise gene relationships by a probability of edge presence, we formulate the regulatory network inference as a discrete variational problem on graphs. We enforce biologically plausible coupling between groups and types of genes by minimizing an edge labeling functional coding for a priori structures. The optimization is carried out with Graph cuts, an approach popular in image processing and computer vision. We compare the inferred regulatory networks to results achieved by the mutual-information-based Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) method and by the state-of-the-art GENIE3, winner of the DREAM4 multifactorial challenge.<h4>Results</h4>Our BRANE Cut approach infers more accurately the five DREAM4 in silico networks (with improvements from 6% to 11%). On a real Escherichia coli compendium, an improvement of 11.8% compared to CLR and 3% compared to GENIE3 is obtained in terms of Area Under Precision-Recall curve. Up to 48 additional verified interactions are obtained over GENIE3 for a given precision. On this dataset involving 4345 genes, our method achieves a performance similar to that of GENIE3, while being more than seven times faster. The BRANE Cut code is available at: http://www-syscom.univ-mlv.fr/~pirayre/Codes-GRN-BRANE-cut.html.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BRANE Cut is a weighted graph thresholding method. Using biologically sound penalties and data-driven parameters, it improves three state-of-the art GRN inference methods. It is applicable as a generic network inference post-processing, due to its computational efficiency.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

It provides quantitative means to explore the transcriptome of an organism of interest. However, interpreting this extremely large data into biological knowledge is a problem, and biologist-friendly tools are lacking. In our lab, we developed Transcriptator, a web application based on a computational Python pipeline with a user-friendly Java interface. This pipeline uses the web services available for BLAST (Basis Local Search Alignment Tool), QuickGO and DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) tools. It offers a report on statistical analysis of functional and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation's enrichment. It helps users to identify enriched biological themes, particularly GO terms, pathways, domains, gene/proteins features and protein-protein interactions related informations. It clusters the transcripts based on functional annotations and generates a tabular report for functional and gene ontology annotations for each submitted transcript to the web server. The implementation of QuickGo web-services in our pipeline enable the users to carry out GO-Slim analysis, whereas the integration of PORTRAIT (Prediction of transcriptomic non coding RNA (ncRNA) by ab initio methods) helps to identify the non coding RNAs and their regulatory role in transcriptome. In summary, Transcriptator is a useful software for both NGS and array data. It helps the users to characterize the de-novo assembled reads, obtained from NGS experiments for non-referenced organisms, while it also performs the functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed transcripts/genes for both RNA-seq and micro-array experiments. It generates easy to read tables and interactive charts for better understanding of the data. The pipeline is modular in nature, and provides an opportunity to add new plugins in the future.

26628858,Characterizing Cancer-Specific Networks by Integrating TCGA Data.,"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) generates comprehensive genomic data for thousands of patients over more than 20 cancer types. TCGA data are typically whole-genome measurements of multiple genomic features, such as DNA copy numbers, DNA methylation, and gene expression, providing unique opportunities for investigating cancer mechanism from multiple molecular and regulatory layers. We propose a Bayesian graphical model to systemically integrate multi-platform TCGA data for inference of the interactions between different genomic features either within a gene or between multiple genes. The presence or absence of edges in the graph indicates the presence or absence of conditional dependence between genomic features. The inference is restricted to genes within a known biological network, but can be extended to any sets of genes. Applying the model to the same genes using patient samples in two different cancer types, we identify network components that are common as well as different between cancer types.

We compared both the prognostic and predictive value of histologic grades and genomic markers.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrieved publicly available cDNA microarray data from 1373 primary ER(+)/HER2(-) breast cancers and developed a genomic signature simulated from Recurrence Online (http://www.recurrenceonline.com/) to calculate the recurrence score and risk using predefined sets of genes in the cDNA microarray. We then compared the prognostic and predictive information provided by histologic grade and genomic signature.<h4>Results</h4>Based on genomic signatures, 55%, 28%, and 17% of breast cancers were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively, whereas the histologic grades were I, II, and III in 22%, 59%, and 19% of breast cancers, respectively. Univariate analysis in the untreated cohort revealed that both histologic grade (overall P = .007) and genomic signature (P < .001) could predict prognosis. Results were similar using the genomic signature, with pathologic complete response rates of 4.6%, 5.7%, and 16.5% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk cancers, respectively. Neither biomarker was statistically significant in multivariate analysis for predictive response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Genomic signature was better at identifying low-risk cases compared to histologic grade alone, but both markers had similar predictive values for NAC response. Better predictive biomarkers for NAC response are still needed.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
26635139,An integrative somatic mutation analysis to identify pathways linked with survival outcomes across 19 cancer types.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Identification of altered pathways that are clinically relevant across human cancers is a key challenge in cancer genomics. Precise identification and understanding of these altered pathways may provide novel insights into patient stratification, therapeutic strategies and the development of new drugs. However, a challenge remains in accurately identifying pathways altered by somatic mutations across human cancers, due to the diverse mutation spectrum. We developed an innovative approach to integrate somatic mutation data with gene networks and pathways, in order to identify pathways altered by somatic mutations across cancers.<h4>Results</h4>We applied our approach to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of somatic mutations in 4790 cancer patients with 19 different types of tumors. Our analysis identified cancer-type-specific altered pathways enriched with known cancer-relevant genes and targets of currently available drugs. To investigate the clinical significance of these altered pathways, we performed consensus clustering for patient stratification using member genes in the altered pathways coupled with gene expression datasets from 4870 patients from TCGA, and multiple independent cohorts confirmed that the altered pathways could be used to stratify patients into subgroups with significantly different clinical outcomes. Of particular significance, certain patient subpopulations with poor prognosis were identified because they had specific altered pathways for which there are available targeted therapies. These findings could be used to tailor and intensify therapy in these patients, for whom current therapy is suboptimal.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The code is available at: http://www.taehyunlab.org<h4>Contact</h4>jhcheong@yuhs.ac or taehyun.hwang@utsouthwestern.edu or taehyun.cs@gmail.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26677962,CG2AA: backmapping protein coarse-grained structures.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Coarse grain (CG) models allow long-scale simulations with a much lower computational cost than that of all-atom simulations. However, the absence of atomistic detail impedes the analysis of specific atomic interactions that are determinant in most interesting biomolecular processes. In order to study these phenomena, it is necessary to reconstruct the atomistic structure from the CG representation. This structure can be analyzed by itself or be used as an onset for atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we present a computer program that accurately reconstructs the atomistic structure from a CG model for proteins, using a simple geometrical algorithm.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software is free and available online at http://www.ic.fcen.uba.ar/cg2aa/cg2aa.py<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.<h4>Contact</h4>lula@qi.fcen.uba.ar.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26678663,EC: an efficient error correction algorithm for short reads.,"<h4>Background</h4>In highly parallel next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques millions to billions of short reads are produced from a genomic sequence in a single run. Due to the limitation of the NGS technologies, there could be errors in the reads. The error rate of the reads can be reduced with trimming and by correcting the erroneous bases of the reads. It helps to achieve high quality data and the computational complexity of many biological applications will be greatly reduced if the reads are first corrected. We have developed a novel error correction algorithm called EC and compared it with four other state-of-the-art algorithms using both real and simulated sequencing reads.<h4>Results</h4>We have done extensive and rigorous experiments that reveal that EC is indeed an effective, scalable, and efficient error correction tool. Real reads that we have employed in our performance evaluation are Illumina-generated short reads of various lengths. Six experimental datasets we have utilized are taken from sequence and read archive (SRA) at NCBI. The simulated reads are obtained by picking substrings from random positions of reference genomes. To introduce errors, some of the bases of the simulated reads are changed to other bases with some probabilities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Error correction is a vital problem in biology especially for NGS data. In this paper we present a novel algorithm, called Error Corrector (EC), for correcting substitution errors in biological sequencing reads. We plan to investigate the possibility of employing the techniques introduced in this research paper to handle insertion and deletion errors also.<h4>Software availability</h4>The implementation is freely available for non-commercial purposes.

26691201,An ultra-high-density map as a community resource for discerning the genetic basis of quantitative traits in maize.,"<h4>Background</h4>To safeguard the food supply for the growing human population, it is important to understand and exploit the genetic basis of quantitative traits. Next-generation sequencing technology performs advantageously and effectively in genetic mapping and genome analysis of diverse genetic resources. Hence, we combined re-sequencing technology and a bin map strategy to construct an ultra-high-density bin map with thousands of bin markers to precisely map a quantitative trait locus.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we generated a linkage map containing 1,151,856 high quality SNPs between Mo17 and B73, which were verified in the maize intermated B73 � Mo17 (IBM) Syn10 population. This resource is an excellent complement to existing maize genetic maps available in an online database� (iPlant, http://data.maizecode.org/maize/qtl/syn10/ ). Moreover, in this population combined with the IBM Syn4 RIL population, we detected 135 QTLs for flowering time and plant height traits across the two populations. Eighteen known functional genes and twenty-five candidate genes for flowering time and plant height trait were fine-mapped into a 2.21-4.96�Mb interval. Map expansion and segregation distortion were also analyzed, and evidence for inadvertent selection of early flowering time in the process of mapping population development was observed. Furthermore, an updated integrated map with 1,151,856 high-quality SNPs, 2,916 traditional markers and 6,618 bin markers was constructed. The data were deposited into the iPlant Discovery Environment (DE), which provides a fundamental resource of genetic data for the maize genetic research community.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings provide basic essential genetic data for the maize genetic research community. An updated IBM Syn10 population and a reliable, verified high-quality SNP set between Mo17 and B73 will aid in future molecular breeding efforts.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Here we describe a 5-d tissue processing and immunostaining procedure that is optimized for SMLM, and we provide example applications to fixed mouse brain, heart and kidney tissues. We then describe how to perform correlated confocal and 3D-superresolution imaging on these sections, which allows the visualization of nanoscale protein localization within labeled subcellular compartments of identified target cells in a few minutes. Finally, we describe the use of VividSTORM (http://katonalab.hu/index.php/vividstorm), an open-source software for correlated confocal and SMLM image analysis, which facilitates the measurement of molecular abundance, clustering, internalization, surface density and intermolecular distances in a cell-specific and subcellular compartment-restricted manner.

The lack of standardized and automated methodologies poses a challenge for the analysis and interpretation of RNA sequencing data. We critically compare and evaluate state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches and present a workflow that integrates the best performing data analysis, data evaluation and annotation methods in a Transparent, Reproducible and Automated PipeLINE (TRAPLINE) for RNA sequencing data processing (suitable for Illumina, SOLiD and Solexa).<h4>Results</h4>Comparative transcriptomics analyses with TRAPLINE result in a set of differentially expressed genes, their corresponding protein-protein interactions, splice variants, promoter activity, predicted miRNA-target interactions and files for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. The obtained results are combined into a single file for downstream analysis such as network construction. We demonstrate the value of the proposed pipeline by characterizing the transcriptome of our recently described stem cell derived antibiotic selected cardiac bodies ('aCaBs').<h4>Conclusion</h4>TRAPLINE supports NGS-based research by providing a workflow that requires no bioinformatics skills, decreases the processing time of the analysis and works in the cloud.

26753561,iMiRNA-SSF: Improving the Identification of MicroRNA Precursors by Combining Negative Sets with Different Distributions.,"The identification of microRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) helps in understanding regulator in biological processes. The performance of computational predictors depends on their training sets, in which the negative sets play an important role. In this regard, we investigated the influence of benchmark datasets on the predictive performance of computational predictors in the field of miRNA identification, and found that the negative samples have significant impact on the predictive results of various methods. We constructed a new benchmark set with different data distributions of negative samples. Trained with this high quality benchmark dataset, a new computational predictor called iMiRNA-SSF was proposed, which employed various features extracted from RNA sequences. Experimental results showed that iMiRNA-SSF outperforms three state-of-the-art computational methods.

26756459,Intranasal or transdermal nicotine for the treatment of postoperative pain.,"<h4>Background</h4>Acute pain frequently occurs after surgical procedures. Nicotine has been explored as an adjunctive medication for management of postoperative pain.��<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess the effect of transdermal or intranasal nicotine administration on postoperative pain, opioid analgesic use, and opioid-related adverse events.��<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched MEDLINE (1966 to 20 March 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 3), EMBASE (1980 to 20 March 2014), and also databases of ongoing trials (www.controlled-trials.com/�and�http://clinicaltrials.gov/). We re-ran the search on 28 April 2015. We will assess the one study of interest when we update the review.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that evaluated the effects of perioperative (pre-, intra-, or postoperative) administration of nicotine on postoperative pain, opioid use, and opioid-related adverse events.�We excluded all other studies.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Two authors independently screened all titles and abstracts for eligibility and documented reasons for exclusion. In case of disagreement, a third author decided on the inclusion or exclusion of a trial report. When additional information was needed in order to decide if a trial should be included, one of the authors contacted the corresponding author of the trial in question.<h4>Main results</h4>Nine trials (666 participants) evaluated nicotine for postoperative pain. Nicotine may reduce postoperative pain scores at 24 hours by a small amount compared with placebo (eight trials, mean difference -0.88 on a 0 to 10 scale, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.58 to -0.18; low quality evidence). The effect on pain at one hour and 12 hours postoperatively was less certain (very low quality evidence). Statistical heterogeneity was substantial and not adequately explained by stratification of trials according to type of surgical procedure, smoking status, mode of nicotine administration, timing of administration, or assessed risk of bias. Excluding one trial at high risk of bias resulted in similar findings. The effect of nicotine on postoperative opioid use was uncertain due to small number of participants in the studies. Nicotine probably increases the risk of postoperative nausea (seven trials, RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50; moderate quality evidence). Three trials assessed sedation but the effect is very uncertain due to the very low quality of evidence. We found no evidence that nicotine increased the risk of vomiting (seven studies, risk difference (RD) 0.03, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.09; low quality evidence). The results from one single small trial were insufficient to establish whether nicotine led to an earlier hospital discharge (very low quality evidence).<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Based on evidence of generally low quality, nicotine may reduce postoperative pain at 24 hours compared with placebo, but the effects were relatively small (less than 1 point on a 10 point pain scale) and there was substantial heterogeneity in the results of our analyses. Nicotine does not appear to reduce postoperative use of opioids or opioid-related adverse events but probably increases the risk of nausea. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of nicotine for postoperative pain and to understand the optimal timing, dose, and method of delivery of nicotine.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26782957,A randomized clinical trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for cancer of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neoadjuvant therapy improves long-term survival after oesophagectomy, treating oesophageal cancer, but the evidence to date is insufficient to determine which of the two main neoadjuvant therapy types, chemotherapy (nCT) or chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), is more beneficial. We aimed to compare the effects of nCT with those of nCRT.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>This multicentre trial, which was conducted in Sweden and Norway, recruited 181 patients with carcinoma of the oesophagus or the gastro-oesophageal junction who were candidates for curative-intended treatment. The primary end point was histological complete response after neoadjuvant treatment, which has been shown to be correlated with increased long-term survival. Study participants were randomized to nCT or nCRT, followed by surgery with two-field lymphadenectomy. Three cycles of platin/5-fluorouracil were administered in both arms, whereas 40 Gy of concomitant radiotherapy was added in the nCRT arm.<h4>Results</h4>The trial met the primary end point, histological complete response being achieved in 28% after nCRT versus 9% after nCT (P = 0.002). Lymph-node metastases were observed in 62% in the nCT group versus 35% in the nCRT group (P = 0.001). The R0 resection rate was 87% after nCRT and 74% after nCT (P = 0.04). There was no difference in overall survival between the treatment arms.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The addition of radiotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in higher histological complete response rate, higher R0 resection rate, and a lower frequency of lymph-node metastases, without significantly affecting survival.<h4>Clinicaltrialsgov</h4>NCT01362127 (https://clinicaltrials.gov; The full study protocol was registered in the Clinical Trials Database).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The symptoms can be ameliorated or prevented by administering pharmacological doses of biotin. Since 2008, approximately 300 samples have been submitted to ARUP's Molecular Sequencing Laboratory for biotinidase mutation analysis. Of these, 48 novel alterations in the biotinidase gene have been identified. Correlating the individual's serum enzymatic activity with the genotype, we have been able to determine the effect of the novel alteration on enzyme activity and, thereby, determine its likelihood of being pathogenic in 44 of these individuals.

26893301,Clustering Genes of Common Evolutionary History.,"Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate tree using data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are incongruent-due to events such as incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer-it can be misleading to infer a single tree. To address this, many previous contributions have taken a mechanistic approach, by modeling specific processes. Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these incongruencies might arise. Such """"process-agnostic"""" approaches typically infer a tree for each locus and cluster these. There are, however, many possible combinations of tree distance and clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because standard model selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied to problems with a variable number of topologies, the issue of inferring the optimal number of clusters is poorly understood. Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of phylogenetic distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing combinations are distances accounting for branch lengths followed by spectral clustering or Ward's method. We also introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal number of clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach by 1) identifying errors in a previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast species and 2) identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced loci of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta We release treeCl, a new program to cluster genes of common evolutionary history (http://git.io/treeCl).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26908244,CERAPP: Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project.,"<h4>Background</h4>Humans are exposed to thousands of man-made chemicals in the environment. Some chemicals mimic natural endocrine hormones and, thus, have the potential to be endocrine disruptors. Most of these chemicals have never been tested for their ability to interact with the estrogen receptor (ER). Risk assessors need tools to prioritize chemicals for evaluation in costly in vivo tests, for instance, within the U.S. EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.<h4>Objectives</h4>We describe a large-scale modeling project called CERAPP (Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project) and demonstrate the efficacy of using predictive computational models trained on high-throughput screening data to evaluate thousands of chemicals for ER-related activity and prioritize them for further testing.<h4>Methods</h4>CERAPP combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict ER activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure-activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. EPA, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist ER activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature. To overcome the limitations of single models, a consensus was built by weighting models on scores based on their evaluated accuracies.<h4>Results</h4>Individual model scores ranged from 0.69 to 0.85, showing high prediction reliabilities. Out of the 32,464 chemicals, the consensus model predicted 4,001 chemicals (12.3%) as high priority actives and 6,742 potential actives (20.8%) to be considered for further testing.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This project demonstrated the possibility to screen large libraries of chemicals using a consensus of different in silico approaches. This concept will be applied in future projects related to other end points.<h4>Citation</h4>Mansouri K, Abdelaziz A, Rybacka A, Roncaglioni A, Tropsha A, Varnek A, Zakharov A, Worth A, Richard AM, Grulke CM, Trisciuzzi D, Fourches D, Horvath D, Benfenati E, Muratov E, Wedebye EB, Grisoni F, Mangiatordi GF, Incisivo GM, Hong H, Ng HW, Tetko IV, Balabin I, Kancherla J, Shen J, Burton J, Nicklaus M, Cassotti M, Nikolov NG, Nicolotti O, Andersson PL, Zang Q, Politi R, Beger RD, Todeschini R, Huang R, Farag S, Rosenberg SA, Slavov S, Hu X, Judson RS. 2016.<h4>Cerapp</h4>Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project.

Modern high-throughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct--but often complementary--information. However, the large amount of data adds burden to any inference task. Flexible Bayesian methods may reduce the necessity for strong modelling assumptions, but can also increase the computational burden. We present an improved implementation of a Bayesian correlated clustering algorithm, that permits integrated clustering to be routinely performed across multiple datasets, each with tens of thousands of items. By exploiting GPU based computation, we are able to improve runtime performance of the algorithm by almost four orders of magnitude. This permits analysis across genomic-scale data sets, greatly expanding the range of applications over those originally possible.

However, the information associated with genes and genetic markers for pumpkin is very limited. In order to identify new genes and to develop genetic markers, we performed a transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) of two contrasting pumpkin cultivars. Leaves and female flowers of cultivars, 'Big Moose' with large round fruits and 'Munchkin' with small round fruits, were harvested for total RNA extraction. We obtained a total of 6�GB (Big Moose; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3056882) and 5�GB (Munchkin; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR3056883) sequence data (NCBI SRA database SRX1502732 and SRX1502735, respectively), which correspond to 18,055,786 and 14,824,292 150-base reads. After quality assessment, the clean sequences where 17,995,932 and 14,774,486 respectively. The numbers of total transcripts for 'Big Moose' and 'Munchkin' were 84,727 and 68,051, respectively.

27030549,The advantage of laser-capture microdissection over whole tissue analysis in proteomic profiling studies.,"Laser-capture microdissection (LCM) offers a reliable cell population enrichment tool and has been successfully coupled to MS analysis. Despite this, most proteomic studies employ whole tissue lysate (WTL) analysis in the discovery of disease biomarkers and in profiling analyses. Furthermore, the influence of tissue heterogeneity in WTL analysis, nor its impact in biomarker discovery studies have been completely elucidated. In order to address this, we compared previously obtained high resolution MS data from a cohort of 38 breast cancer tissues, of which both LCM enriched tumor epithelial cells and WTL samples were analyzed. Label-free quantification (LFQ) analysis through MaxQuant software showed a significantly higher number of identified and quantified proteins in LCM enriched samples (3404) compared to WTLs (2837). Furthermore, WTL samples displayed a higher amount of missing data compared to LCM both at peptide and protein levels (p-value < 0.001). 2D analysis on co-expressed proteins revealed discrepant expression of immune system and lipid metabolisms related proteins between LCM and WTL samples. We hereby show that LCM better dissected the biology of breast tumor epithelial cells, possibly due to lower interference from surrounding tissues and highly abundant proteins.

27076459,Inferring microRNA-disease associations by random walk on a heterogeneous network with multiple data sources.,"Since the discovery of the regulatory function of microRNA (miRNA), increased attention has focused on identifying the relationship between miRNA and disease. It has been suggested that computational method are an efficient way to identify potential disease-related miRNAs for further confirmation using biological experiments. In this paper, we first highlighted three limitations commonly associated with previous computational methods. To resolve these limitations, we established disease similarity subnetwork and miRNA similarity subnetwork by integrating multiple data sources, where the disease similarity is composed of disease semantic similarity and disease functional similarity, and the miRNA similarity is calculated using the miRNA-target gene and miRNA-lncRNA (long non-coding RNA) associations. Then, a heterogeneous network was constructed by connecting the disease similarity subnetwork and the miRNA similarity subnetwork using the known miRNA-disease associations. We extended random walk with restart to predict miRNA-disease associations in the heterogeneous network. The leave-one-out cross-validation achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0:8049 across 341 diseases and 476 miRNAs. For five-fold cross-validation, our method achieved an AUC from 0:7970 to 0:9249 for 15 human diseases. Case studies further demonstrated the feasibility of our method to discover potential miRNA-disease associations.

27092486,Profilings of MicroRNAs in the Liver of Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio) Infected with Flavobacterium columnare.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in regulation of many biological processes in eukaryotes, including pathogen infection and host interactions. Flavobacterium columnare (FC) infection can cause great economic loss of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) which is one of the most important cultured fish in the world. However, miRNAs in response to FC infection in common carp has not been characterized. To identify specific miRNAs involved in common carp infected with FC, we performed microRNA sequencing using livers of common carp infected with and without FC. A total of 698 miRNAs were identified, including 142 which were identified and deposited in the miRbase database (Available online: http://www.mirbase.org/) and 556 had only predicted miRNAs. Among the deposited miRNAs, eight miRNAs were first identified in common carp. Thirty of the 698 miRNAs were differentially expressed miRNAs (DIE-miRNAs) between the FC infected and control samples. From the DIE-miRNAs, seven were selected randomly and their expression profiles were confirmed to be consistent with the microRNA sequencing results using RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. In addition, a total of 27,363 target genes of the 30 DIE-miRNAs were predicted. The target genes were enriched in five Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, including focal adhesion, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB) signaling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and adherent junction. The miRNA expression profile of the liver of common carp infected with FC will pave the way for the development of effective strategies to fight against FC infection.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27102804,Using expected sequence features to improve basecalling accuracy of amplicon pyrosequencing data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Amplicon pyrosequencing targets a known genetic region and thus inherently produces reads highly anticipated to have certain features, such as conserved nucleotide sequence, and in the case of protein coding DNA, an open reading frame. Pyrosequencing errors, consisting mainly of nucleotide insertions and deletions, are on the other hand likely to disrupt open reading frames. Such an inverse relationship between errors and expectation based on prior knowledge can be used advantageously to guide the process known as basecalling, i.e. the inference of nucleotide sequence from raw sequencing data.<h4>Results</h4>The new basecalling method described here, named Multipass, implements a probabilistic framework for working with the raw flowgrams obtained by pyrosequencing. For each sequence variant Multipass calculates the likelihood and nucleotide sequence of several most likely sequences given the flowgram data. This probabilistic approach enables integration of basecalling into a larger model where other parameters can be incorporated, such as the likelihood for observing a full-length open reading frame at the targeted region. We apply the method to 454 amplicon pyrosequencing data obtained from a malaria virulence gene family, where Multipass generates 20 % more error-free sequences than current state of the art methods, and provides sequence characteristics that allow generation of a set of high confidence error-free sequences.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This novel method can be used to increase accuracy of existing and future amplicon sequencing data, particularly where extensive prior knowledge is available about the obtained sequences, for example in analysis of the immunoglobulin VDJ region where Multipass can be combined with a model for the known recombining germline genes. Multipass is available for Roche 454 data at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MultiPass-1.0 , and the concept can potentially be implemented for other sequencing technologies as well.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27113639,Vapocoolants (cold spray) for pain treatment during intravenous cannulation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Intravenous cannulation is a painful procedure that can provoke anxiety and stress. Injecting local anaesthetic can provide analgesia at the time of cannulation, but it is a painful procedure. Topical anaesthetic creams take between 30 and 90 minutes to produce an effect. A quicker acting analgesic allows more timely investigation and treatment. Vapocoolants have been used in this setting, but studies have reported mixed results.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine effects of vapocoolants on pain associated with intravenous cannulation in adults and children. To explore variables that might affect the performance of vapocoolants, including time required for application, distance from the skin when applied and time to cannulation. To look at adverse effects associated with the use of vapocoolants.<h4>Search methods</h4>We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science and the http://clinicaltrials.gov/, http://www.controlled-trials.com/ and http://www.trialscentral.org/ databases to 1 May 2015. We applied no language restrictions. We also scanned the reference lists of included papers.<h4>Selection criteria</h4>We included all blinded and unblinded randomized controlled trials (RTCs) comparing any vapocoolant with placebo or control to reduce pain during intravenous cannulation in adults and children.<h4>Data collection and analysis</h4>Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, contacted study authors for additional information and assessed included studies for risk of bias. We collected and analysed data for the primary outcome of pain during cannulation, and for the secondary outcomes of pain associated with application of the vapocoolant, first attempt success rate of intravenous cannulation, adverse events and participant satisfaction. We performed subgroup analyses for the primary outcome to examine differences based on age of participant, type of vapocoolant used, application time of vapocoolant and clinical situation (emergency vs elective). We used random-effects model meta-analysis in RevMan 5.3 and assessed heterogeneity between trial results by examining forest plots and calculating the I(2) statistic.<h4>Main results</h4>We found nine suitable studies of 1070 participants and included them in the qualitative analyses. We included eight studies of 848 participants in the meta-analysis for the primary outcome (pain during intravenous cannulation). Use of vapocoolants resulted in a reduction in pain scores as measured by a linear 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS 100) compared with controls (difference between means -12.5 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -18.7 to -6.4 mm; moderate-quality evidence). We could not include in the meta-analysis one study, which showed no effects of the intervention.Use of vapocoolants resulted in increased pain scores at the time of application as measured by a VAS 100 compared with controls (difference between means 6.3 mm, 95% CI 2.2 to 10.3 mm; four studies, 461 participants; high-quality evidence) and led to no difference in first attempt success compared with controls (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.06; six studies, 812 participants; moderate-quality evidence). We documented eight minor adverse events reported in 279 vapocoolant participants (risk difference (RD) 0.03, 95% CI 0 to 0.05; five studies, 551 participants; low quality-evidence).The overall risk of bias of individual studies ranged from low to high, with high risk of bias for performance and detection bias in four studies. Sensitivity analysis showed that exclusion of studies at high or unclear risk of bias did not materially alter the results of this review.<h4>Authors' conclusions</h4>Moderate-quality evidence indicates that use of a vapocoolant immediately before intravenous cannulation reduces pain during the procedure. Use of vapocoolant does not increase the difficulty of cannulation nor cause serious adverse effects but is associated with mild discomfort during application.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

27152837,Evaluation of OASIS QSAR Models Using ToxCast™ in Vitro Estrogen and Androgen Receptor Binding Data and Application in an Integrated Endocrine Screening Approach.,"<h4>Background</h4>Integrative testing strategies (ITSs) for potential endocrine activity can use tiered in silico and in vitro models. Each component of an ITS should be thoroughly assessed.<h4>Objectives</h4>We used the data from three in vitro ToxCast� binding assays to assess OASIS, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) platform covering both estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) binding. For stronger binders (described here as AC50 < 1 �M), we also examined the relationship of QSAR predictions of ER or AR binding to the results from 18 ER and 10 AR transactivation assays, 72 ER-binding reference compounds, and the in vivo uterotrophic assay.<h4>Methods</h4>NovaScreen binding assay data for ER (human, bovine, and mouse) and AR (human, chimpanzee, and rat) were used to assess the sensitivity, specificity, concordance, and applicability domain of two OASIS QSAR models. The binding strength relative to the QSAR-predicted binding strength was examined for the ER data. The relationship of QSAR predictions of binding to transactivation- and pathway-based assays, as well as to in vivo uterotrophic responses, was examined.<h4>Results</h4>The QSAR models had both high sensitivity (> 75%) and specificity (> 86%) for ER as well as both high sensitivity (92-100%) and specificity (70-81%) for AR. For compounds within the domains of the ER and AR QSAR models that bound with AC50 < 1 �M, the QSAR models accurately predicted the binding for the parent compounds. The parent compounds were active in all transactivation assays where metabolism was incorporated and, except for those compounds known to require metabolism to manifest activity, all assay platforms where metabolism was not incorporated. Compounds in-domain and predicted to bind by the ER QSAR model that were positive in ToxCast� ER binding at AC50 < 1 �M were active in the uterotrophic assay.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We used the extensive ToxCast� HTS binding data set to show that OASIS ER and AR QSAR models had high sensitivity and specificity when compounds were in-domain of the models. Based on this research, we recommend a tiered screening approach wherein a) QSAR is used to identify compounds in-domain of the ER or AR binding models and predicted to bind; b) those compounds are screened in vitro to assess binding potency; and c) the stronger binders (AC50 < 1 �M) are screened in vivo. This scheme prioritizes compounds for integrative testing and risk assessment. Importantly, compounds that are not in-domain, that are predicted either not to bind or to bind weakly, that are not active in in vitro, that require metabolism to manifest activity, or for which in vivo AR testing is in order, need to be assessed differently.<h4>Citation</h4>Bhhatarai B, Wilson DM, Price PS, Marty S, Parks AK, Carney E. 2016.

27153703,Phasing for medical sequencing using rare variants and large haplotype reference panels.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>There is growing recognition that estimating haplotypes from high coverage sequencing of single samples in clinical settings is an important problem. At the same time very large datasets consisting of tens and hundreds of thousands of high-coverage sequenced samples will soon be available. We describe a method that takes advantage of these huge human genetic variation resources and rare variant sharing patterns to estimate haplotypes on single sequenced samples. Sharing rare variants between two individuals is more likely to arise from a recent common ancestor and, hence, also more likely to indicate similar shared haplotypes over a substantial flanking region of sequence.<h4>Results</h4>Our method exploits this idea to select a small set of highly informative copying states within a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) phasing algorithm. Using rare variants in this way allows us to avoid iterative MCMC methods to infer haplotypes. Compared to other approaches that do not explicitly use rare variants we obtain significant gains in phasing accuracy, less variation over phasing runs and improvements in speed. For example, using a reference panel of 7420 haplotypes from the UK10K project, we are able to reduce switch error rates by up to 50% when phasing samples sequenced at high-coverage. In addition, a single step rephasing of the UK10K panel, using rare variant information, has a downstream impact on phasing performance. These results represent a proof of concept that rare variant sharing patterns can be utilized to phase large high-coverage sequencing studies such as the 100 000 Genomes Project dataset.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A webserver that includes an implementation of this new method and allows phasing of high-coverage clinical samples is available at https://phasingserver.stats.ox.ac.uk/<h4>Contact</h4>marchini@stats.ox.ac.uk<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27164621,Prioritizing Chemicals for Risk Assessment Using Chemoinformatics: Examples from the IARC Monographs on Pesticides.,"<h4>Background</h4>Identifying cancer hazards is the first step towards cancer prevention. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs Programme, which has evaluated nearly 1,000 agents for their carcinogenic potential since 1971, typically selects agents for hazard identification on the basis of public nominations, expert advice, published data on carcinogenicity, and public health importance.<h4>Objectives</h4>Here, we present a novel and complementary strategy for identifying agents for hazard evaluation using chemoinformatics, database integration, and automated text mining.<h4>Discussion</h4>To inform selection among a broad range of pesticides nominated for evaluation, we identified and screened nearly 6,000 relevant chemical structures, after which we systematically compiled information on 980 pesticides, creating network maps that allowed cluster visualization by chemical similarity, pesticide class, and publicly available information concerning cancer epidemiology, cancer bioassays, and carcinogenic mechanisms. For the IARC Monograph meetings that took place in March and June 2015, this approach supported high-priority evaluation of glyphosate, malathion, parathion, tetrachlorvinphos, diazinon, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), lindane, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This systematic approach, accounting for chemical similarity and overlaying multiple data sources, can be used by risk assessors as well as by researchers to systematize, inform, and increase efficiency in selecting and prioritizing agents for hazard identification, risk assessment, regulation, or further investigation. This approach could be extended to an array of outcomes and agents, including occupational carcinogens, drugs, and foods. Citation: Guha N, Guyton KZ, Loomis D, Barupal DK. 2016.

27187006,Targeting vascular (endothelial) dysfunction.,"Cardiovascular diseases are major contributors to global deaths and disability-adjusted life years, with hypertension a significant risk factor for all causes of death. The endothelium that lines the inner wall of the vasculature regulates essential haemostatic functions, such as vascular tone, circulation of blood cells, inflammation and platelet activity. Endothelial dysfunction is an early predictor of atherosclerosis and future cardiovascular events. We review the prognostic value of obtaining measurements of endothelial function, the clinical techniques for its determination, the mechanisms leading to endothelial dysfunction and the therapeutic treatment of endothelial dysfunction. Since vascular oxidative stress and inflammation are major determinants of endothelial function, we have also addressed current antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. In the light of recent data that dispute the prognostic value of endothelial function in healthy human cohorts, we also discuss alternative diagnostic parameters such as vascular stiffness index and intima/media thickness ratio. We also suggest that assessing vascular function, including that of smooth muscle and even perivascular adipose tissue, may be an appropriate parameter for clinical investigations.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Redox Biology and Oxidative Stress in Health and Disease.

27296980,Unbiased probabilistic taxonomic classification for DNA barcoding.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>When targeted to a barcoding region, high-throughput sequencing can be used to identify species or operational taxonomical units from environmental samples, and thus to study the diversity and structure of species communities. Although there are many methods which provide confidence scores for assigning taxonomic affiliations, it is not straightforward to translate these values to unbiased probabilities. We present a probabilistic method for taxonomical classification (PROTAX) of DNA sequences. Given a pre-defined taxonomical tree structure that is partially populated by reference sequences, PROTAX decomposes the probability of one to the set of all possible outcomes. PROTAX accounts for species that are present in the taxonomy but that do not have reference sequences, the possibility of unknown taxonomical units, as well as mislabeled reference sequences. PROTAX is based on a statistical multinomial regression model, and it can utilize any kind of sequence similarity measures or the outputs of other classifiers as predictors.<h4>Results</h4>We demonstrate the performance of PROTAX by using as predictors the output from BLAST, the phylogenetic classification software TIPP, and the RDP classifier. We show that PROTAX improves the predictions of the baseline implementations of TIPP and RDP classifiers, and that it is able to combine complementary information provided by BLAST and TIPP, resulting in accurate and unbiased classifications even with very challenging cases such as 50% mislabeling of reference sequences.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Perl/R implementation of PROTAX is available at http://www.helsinki.fi/science/metapop/Software.htm<h4>Contact</h4>panu.somervuo@helsinki.fi<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27307608,Convolutional neural network architectures for predicting DNA-protein binding.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed conventional methods in modeling the sequence specificity of DNA-protein binding. Yet inappropriate CNN architectures can yield poorer performance than simpler models. Thus an in-depth understanding of how to match CNN architecture to a given task is needed to fully harness the power of CNNs for computational biology applications.<h4>Results</h4>We present a systematic exploration of CNN architectures for predicting DNA sequence binding using a large compendium of transcription factor datasets. We identify the best-performing architectures by varying CNN width, depth and pooling designs. We find that adding convolutional kernels to a network is important for motif-based tasks. We show the benefits of CNNs in learning rich higher-order sequence features, such as secondary motifs and local sequence context, by comparing network performance on multiple modeling tasks ranging in difficulty. We also demonstrate how careful construction of sequence benchmark datasets, using approaches that control potentially confounding effects like positional or motif strength bias, is critical in making fair comparisons between competing methods. We explore how to establish the sufficiency of training data for these learning tasks, and we have created a flexible cloud-based framework that permits the rapid exploration of alternative neural network architectures for problems in computational biology.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All the models analyzed are available at http://cnn.csail.mit.edu<h4>Contact</h4>gifford@mit.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27307636,DFLpred: High-throughput prediction of disordered flexible linker regions in protein sequences.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Disordered flexible linkers (DFLs) are disordered regions that serve as flexible linkers/spacers in multi-domain proteins or between structured constituents in domains. They are different from flexible linkers/residues because they are disordered and longer. Availability of experimentally annotated DFLs provides an opportunity to build high-throughput computational predictors of these regions from protein sequences. To date, there are no computational methods that directly predict DFLs and they can be found only indirectly by filtering predicted flexible residues with predictions of disorder.<h4>Results</h4>We conceptualized, developed and empirically assessed a first-of-its-kind sequence-based predictor of DFLs, DFLpred. This method outputs propensity to form DFLs for each residue in the input sequence. DFLpred uses a small set of empirically selected features that quantify propensities to form certain secondary structures, disordered regions and structured regions, which are processed by a fast linear model. Our high-throughput predictor can be used on the whole-proteome scale; it needs <1 h to predict entire proteome on a single CPU. When assessed on an independent test dataset with low sequence-identity proteins, it secures area under the receiver operating characteristic curve equal 0.715 and outperforms existing alternatives that include methods for the prediction of flexible linkers, flexible residues, intrinsically disordered residues and various combinations of these methods. Prediction on the complete human proteome reveals that about 10% of proteins have a large content of over 30% DFL residues. We also estimate that about 6000 DFL regions are long with =30 consecutive residues.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/DFLpred/<h4>Contact</h4>lkurgan@vcu.edu<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27307645,BioASF: a framework for automatically generating executable pathway models specified in BioPAX.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Biological pathways play a key role in most cellular functions. To better understand these functions, diverse computational and cell biology researchers use biological pathway data for various analysis and modeling purposes. For specifying these biological pathways, a community of researchers has defined BioPAX and provided various tools for creating, validating and visualizing BioPAX models. However, a generic software framework for simulating BioPAX models is missing. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by introducing a generic simulation framework for BioPAX. The framework explicitly separates the execution model from the model structure as provided by BioPAX, with the advantage that the modelling process becomes more reproducible and intrinsically more modular; this ensures natural biological constraints are satisfied upon execution. The framework is based on the principles of discrete event systems and multi-agent systems, and is capable of automatically generating a hierarchical multi-agent system for a given BioPAX model.<h4>Results</h4>To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, we simulated two types of biological network models: a gene regulatory network modeling the haematopoietic stem cell regulators and a signal transduction network modeling the Wnt/�-catenin signaling pathway. We observed that the results of the simulations performed using our framework were entirely consistent with the simulation results reported by the researchers who developed the original models in a proprietary language.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The framework, implemented in Java, is open source and its source code, documentation and tutorial are available at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/BioASF CONTACT: j.heringa@vu.nl.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

In low-quality assemblies, and even some high-quality assemblies, certain gene regions are still incomplete; thus, novel scaffolding approaches are required to complete gene regions.<h4>Results</h4>We developed an efficient and fast genome scaffolding method called PEP_scaffolder, using proteins to scaffold genomes. The pipeline aims to recover protein-coding gene structures. We tested the method on human contigs; using human UniProt proteins as guides, the improvement on N50 size was 17% increase with an accuracy of ~97%. PEP_scaffolder improved the proportion of fully covered proteins among all proteins, which was close to the proportion in the finished genome. The method provided a high accuracy of 91% using orthologs of distant species.

These data sources can be temporally limited, spatially aggregated, subjective, and burdensome for the patient to collect.<h4>Objectives</h4>First, we aimed to test the feasibility of collecting rescue inhaler use data in space-time using electronic sensors. Second, we aimed to evaluate whether these data have the potential to identify environmental triggers and built environment factors associated with rescue inhaler use and to determine whether these findings would be consistent with the existing literature.<h4>Methods</h4>We utilized zero-truncated negative binomial models to identify triggers associated with inhaler use, and implemented three sensitivity analyses to validate our findings.<h4>Results</h4>Electronic sensors fitted on metered dose inhalers tracked 5,660 rescue inhaler use events in space and time for 140 participants from 13 June 2012 to 28 February 2014. We found that the inhaler sensors were feasible in passively collecting objective rescue inhaler use data. We identified several environmental triggers with a positive and significant association with inhaler use, including: AQI, PM10, weed pollen, and mold. Conversely, the spatial distribution of tree cover demonstrated a negative and significant association with inhaler use.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Utilizing a sensor to capture the signal of rescue inhaler use in space-time offered a passive and objective signal of asthma activity. This approach enabled detailed analyses to identify environmental triggers and built environment factors that are associated with asthma symptoms beyond the residential address. The application of these new technologies has the potential to improve our surveillance and understanding of asthma.

The population data were obtained every year from 2010 to 2014 from the Korean Statistical Information Service (http://kosis.kr/). The annual percent change (APC) and statistical significance were calculated using the Joinpoint software.<h4>Results</h4>From January 2010 to December 2014, 25,687 patients underwent 25,921 lung cancer surgeries, which increased by 45.1% from 2010 to 2014. The crude incidence rate of lung cancer surgery in each year increased significantly (APC, 9.5; p < 0.05). The male-to-female ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.6 (APC, -6.3; p < 0.05). The incidence increased in the age group of = 70 years for both sexes (male: APC, 3.7; p < 0.05; female: APC, 5.96; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the proportion of female patients aged = 65 years increased (APC, 7.2; p < 0.05), while that of male patients aged < 65 years decreased (APC, -3.9; p < 0.05).

PASS predicted biological activity profiles are used as independent input variables for QSAR modelling with SCR. QSAR models were developed using LD50 values for compounds tested on rats with four types of administration (oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous). The proposed method was evaluated on the set of compounds tested for acute rat toxicity with oral administration (7286 compounds) used for testing the known QSAR methods in T.E.S.T. 3.0 program (U.S. EPA). The several other sets of compounds tested for acute rat toxicity by different routes of administration selected from SYMYX MDL Toxicity Database were used too. The method was compared with the results of prediction of acute rodent toxicity for noncongeneric sets obtained by ACD/Labs Inc. The test sets were predicted with regards to the applicability domain. Comparison of accuracy for QSAR models obtained separately using QNA descriptors, PASS predictions, nearest neighbours' assessment with consensus models clearly demonstrated the benefits of consensus prediction.

27596593,Order restricted inference for oscillatory systems for detecting rhythmic signals.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Many biological processes, such as cell cycle, circadian clock, menstrual cycles, are governed by oscillatory systems consisting of numerous components that exhibit rhythmic patterns over time. It is not always easy to identify such rhythmic components. For example, it is a challenging problem to identify circadian genes in a given tissue using time-course gene expression data. There is a great potential for misclassifying non-rhythmic as rhythmic genes and vice versa. This has been a problem of considerable interest in recent years. In this article we develop a constrained inference based methodology called Order Restricted Inference for Oscillatory Systems (ORIOS) to detect rhythmic signals. Instead of using mathematical functions (e.g. sinusoidal) to describe shape of rhythmic signals, ORIOS uses mathematical inequalities. Consequently, it is robust and not limited by the biologist's choice of the mathematical model. We studied the performance of ORIOS using simulated as well as real data obtained from mouse liver, pituitary gland and data from NIH3T3, U2OS cell lines. Our results suggest that, for a broad collection of patterns of gene expression, ORIOS has substantially higher power to detect true rhythmic genes in comparison to some popular methods, while also declaring substantially fewer non-rhythmic genes as rhythmic.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A user friendly code implemented in R language can be downloaded from http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/atniehs/labs/bb/staff/peddada/index.cfm CONTACT: peddada@niehs.nih.gov.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27597880,Functional networks inference from rule-based machine learning models.,"<h4>Background</h4>Functional networks play an important role in the analysis of biological processes and systems. The inference of these networks from high-throughput (-omics) data is an area of intense research. So far, the similarity-based inference paradigm (e.g. gene co-expression) has been the most popular approach. It assumes a functional relationship between genes which are expressed at similar levels across different samples. An alternative to this paradigm is the inference of relationships from the structure of machine learning models. These models are able to capture complex relationships between variables, that often are different/complementary to the similarity-based methods.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a protocol to infer functional networks from machine learning models, called FuNeL. It assumes, that genes used together within a rule-based machine learning model to classify the samples, might also be functionally related at a biological level. The protocol is first tested on synthetic datasets and then evaluated on a test suite of 8 real-world datasets related to human cancer. The networks inferred from the real-world data are compared against gene co-expression networks of equal size, generated with 3 different methods. The comparison is performed from two different points of view. We analyse the enriched biological terms in the set of network nodes and the relationships between known disease-associated genes in a context of the network topology. The comparison confirms both the biological relevance and the complementary character of the knowledge captured by the FuNeL networks in relation to similarity-based methods and demonstrates its potential to identify known disease associations as core elements of the network. Finally, using a prostate cancer dataset as a case study, we confirm that the biological knowledge captured by our method is relevant to the disease and consistent with the specialised literature and with an independent dataset not used in the inference process.<h4>Availability</h4>The implementation of our network inference protocol is available at: http://ico2s.org/software/funel.html.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
27604408,ExonImpact: Prioritizing Pathogenic Alternative Splicing Events.,"Alternative splicing (AS) is a closely regulated process that allows a single gene to encode multiple protein isoforms, thereby contributing to the diversity of the proteome. Dysregulation of the splicing process has been found to be associated with many inherited diseases. However, among the pathogenic AS events, there are numerous """"passenger"""" events whose inclusion or exclusion does not lead to significant changes with respect to protein function. In this study, we evaluate the secondary and tertiary structural features of proteins associated with disease-causing and neutral AS events, and show that several structural features are strongly associated with the pathological impact of exon inclusion. We further develop a machine-learning-based computational model, ExonImpact, for prioritizing and evaluating the functional consequences of hitherto uncharacterized AS events. We evaluated our model using several strategies including cross-validation, and data from the Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) and ClinVar databases.

27660521,AxIOM: Amphipod crustaceans from insular Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows.,"<h4>Background</h4>The Neptune grass, Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813, is the most widespread seagrass of the Mediterranean Sea. This foundation species forms large meadows that, through habitat and trophic services, act as biodiversity hotspots. In Neptune grass meadows, amphipod crustaceans are one of the dominant groups of vagile invertebrates, forming an abundant and diverse taxocenosis. They are key ecological components of the complex, pivotal, yet critically endangered Neptune grass ecosystems. Nevertheless, comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data about amphipod fauna found in Mediterranean Neptune grass meadows remain scarce, especially in insular locations.<h4>New information</h4>Here, we provide in-depth metadata about AxIOM, a sample-based dataset published on the GBIF portal. AxIOM is based on an extensive and spatially hierarchized sampling design with multiple years, seasons, day periods, and methods. Samples were taken along the coasts of Calvi Bay (Corsica, France) and of the Tavolara-Punta Coda Cavallo Marine Protected Area (Sardinia, Italy). In total, AxIOM contains 187 samples documenting occurrence (1775 records) and abundance (10720 specimens) of amphipod crustaceans belonging to 72 species spanning 29 families.

27660889,MINFIT: A Spreadsheet-Based Tool for Parameter Estimation in an Equilibrium Speciation Software Program.,"Determination of equilibrium constants describing chemical reactions in the aqueous phase and at solid-water interface relies on inverse modeling and parameter estimation. Although there are existing tools available, the steep learning curve prevents the wider community of environmental engineers and chemists to adopt those tools. Stemming from classical chemical equilibrium codes, MINEQL+ has been one of the most widely used chemical equilibrium software programs. We developed a spreadsheet-based tool, which we are calling MINFIT, that interacts with MINEQL+ to perform parameter estimations that optimize model fits to experimental data sets. MINFIT enables automatic and convenient screening of a large number of parameter sets toward the optimal solutions by calling MINEQL+ to perform iterative forward calculations following either exhaustive equidistant grid search or randomized search algorithms. The combined use of the two algorithms can securely guide the searches for the global optima. We developed interactive interfaces so that the optimization processes are transparent. Benchmark examples including both aqueous and surface complexation problems illustrate the parameter estimation and associated sensitivity analysis.

27796840,An IoT-cloud Based Wearable ECG Monitoring System for Smart Healthcare.,"Public healthcare has been paid an increasing attention given the exponential growth human population and medical expenses. It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

27895719,DRABAL: novel method to mine large high-throughput screening assays using Bayesian active learning.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mining high-throughput screening (HTS) assays is key for enhancing decisions in the area of drug repositioning and drug discovery. However, many challenges are encountered in the process of developing suitable and accurate methods for extracting useful information from these assays. Virtual screening and a wide variety of databases, methods and solutions proposed to-date, did not completely overcome these challenges. This study is based on a multi-label classification (MLC) technique for modeling correlations between several HTS assays, meaning that a single prediction represents a subset of assigned correlated labels instead of one label. Thus, the devised method provides an increased probability for more accurate predictions of compounds that were not tested in particular assays.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present DRABAL, a novel MLC solution that incorporates structure learning of a Bayesian network as a step to model dependency between the HTS assays. In this study, DRABAL was used to process more than 1.4 million interactions of over 400,000 compounds and analyze the existing relationships between five large HTS assays from the PubChem BioAssay Database. Compared to different MLC methods, DRABAL significantly improves the F<sub>1</sub>Score by about 22%, on average. We further illustrated usefulness and utility of DRABAL through screening FDA approved drugs and reported ones that have a high probability to interact with several targets, thus enabling drug-multi-target repositioning. Specifically DRABAL suggests the Thiabendazole drug as a common activator of the NCP1 and Rab-9A proteins, both of which are designed to identify treatment modalities for the Niemann-Pick type C disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a novel MLC solution based on a Bayesian active learning framework to overcome the challenge of lacking fully labeled training data and exploit actual dependencies between the HTS assays. The solution is motivated by the need to model dependencies between existing experimental confirmatory HTS assays and improve prediction performance. We have pursued extensive experiments over several HTS assays and have shown the advantages of DRABAL.

27976886,MIB: Metal Ion-Binding Site Prediction and Docking Server.,"The structure of a protein determines its biological function(s) and its interactions with other factors; the binding regions tend to be conserved in sequence and structure, and the interacting residues involved are usually in close 3D space. The Protein Data Bank currently contains more than 110�000 protein structures, approximately one-third of which contain metal ions. Identifying and characterizing metal ion-binding sites is thus essential for investigating a protein's function(s) and interactions. However, experimental approaches are time-consuming and costly. The web server reported here was built to predict metal ion-binding residues and to generate the predicted metal ion-bound 3D structure. Binding templates have been constructed for regions that bind 12 types of metal ion-binding residues have been used to construct binding templates. The templates include residues within 3.5 � of the metal ion, and the fragment transformation method was used for structural comparison between query proteins and templates without any data training. Through the adjustment of scoring functions, which are based on the similarity of structure and binding residues.

28130241,Classification of RNA structure change by 'gazing' at experimental data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mutations (or Single Nucleotide Variants) in folded RiboNucleic Acid structures that cause local or global conformational change are riboSNitches. Predicting riboSNitches is challenging, as it requires making two, albeit related, structure predictions. The data most often used to experimentally validate riboSNitch predictions is Selective 2' Hydroxyl Acylation by Primer Extension, or SHAPE. Experimentally establishing a riboSNitch requires the quantitative comparison of two SHAPE traces: wild-type (WT) and mutant. Historically, SHAPE data was collected on electropherograms and change in structure was evaluated by 'gel gazing.' SHAPE data is now routinely collected with next generation sequencing and/or capillary sequencers. We aim to establish a classifier capable of simulating human 'gazing' by identifying features of the SHAPE profile that human experts agree 'looks' like a riboSNitch.<h4>Results</h4>We find strong quantitative agreement between experts when RNA scientists 'gaze' at SHAPE data and identify riboSNitches. We identify dynamic time warping and seven other features predictive of the human consensus. The classSNitch classifier reported here accurately reproduces human consensus for 167 mutant/WT comparisons with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) above 0.8. When we analyze 2019 mutant traces for 17 different RNAs, we find that features of the WT SHAPE reactivity allow us to improve thermodynamic structure predictions of riboSNitches. This is significant, as accurate RNA structural analysis and prediction is likely to become an important aspect of precision medicine.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The classSNitch R package is freely available at http://classsnitch.r-forge.r-project.org .<h4>Contact</h4>alain@email.unc.edu.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28137292,Correcting for cell-type effects in DNA methylation studies: reference-based method outperforms latent variable approaches in empirical studies.,"Based on an extensive simulation study, McGregor and colleagues recently recommended the use of surrogate variable analysis (SVA) to control for the confounding effects of cell-type heterogeneity in DNA methylation association studies in scenarios where no cell-type proportions are available. As their recommendation was mainly based on simulated data, we sought to replicate findings in two large-scale empirical studies. In our empirical data, SVA did not fully correct for cell-type effects, its performance was somewhat unstable, and it carried a risk of missing true signals caused by removing variation that might be linked to actual disease processes. By contrast, a reference-based correction method performed well and did not show these limitations. A disadvantage of this approach is that if reference methylomes are not (publicly) available, they will need to be generated once for a small set of samples. However, given the notable risk we observed for cell-type confounding, we argue that, to avoid introducing false-positive findings into the literature, it could be well worth making this investment.Please see related Correspondence article: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10/1186/s13059-017-1149-7 and related Research article: https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-016-0935-y.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

28238542,Aberrant expression of cell cycle and material metabolism related genes contributes to hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence.,"This study aims to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We first downloaded a gene expression profile dataset GSE29721 (10 HCC and 10 control samples) from Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the paired t-test using limma package. Pathway and functional enrichment analyses were performed with DAVID tools. Transcription factors were annotated with TRANSFAC database and tumor associated genes (TAGs) were annotated with TAG and TSGene databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was conducted using STRING online tool and function module was further identified with BioNet package. Totally, 527 up-regulated DEGs and 587 down-regulated DEGs were identified. GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that the up-regulated DEGs were mainly related to cell division and cell cycle, while the down-regulated DEGs were largely related to material metabolism, especially secondary metabolism. Proteins encoded by DEGs CDK1, BUB1, CDC20, NCAPG, NDC80, CDCA8, MAD2L1, CCNB1, CCNA2 and BIRC5 were hub genes with high degrees in the PPI network; further module analysis detected a subnetwork consisting of 55 proteins, such as CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2. Taken together, aberrant expression of cell cycle related genes (e.g., CDK1, CCNA2, CCNB1, BUB1, MAD2L1 and CDC20) and material metabolism related genes (e.g., CYP2B6, ACAA1, BHMT and ALDH2) may contribute to HCC occurrence.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
28254065,"biomechZoo: An open-source toolbox for the processing, analysis, and visualization of biomechanical movement data.","It is common for biomechanics data sets to contain numerous dependent variables recorded over time, for many subjects, groups, and/or conditions. These data often require standard sorting, processing, and analysis operations to be performed in order to answer research questions. Visualization of these data is also crucial. This manuscript presents biomechZoo, an open-source toolbox that provides tools and graphical user interfaces to help users achieve these goals. The aims of this manuscript are to (1) introduce the main features of the toolbox, including a virtual three-dimensional environment to animate motion data (Director), a data plotting suite (Ensembler), and functions for the computation of three-dimensional lower-limb joint angles, moments, and power and (2) compare these computations to those of an existing validated system. To these ends, the steps required to process and analyze a sample data set via the toolbox are outlined. The data set comprises three-dimensional marker, ground reaction force (GRF), joint kinematic, and joint kinetic data of subjects performing straight walking and 90� turning manoeuvres. Joint kinematics and kinetics processed within the toolbox were found to be similar to outputs from a commercial system. The biomechZoo toolbox represents the work of several years and multiple contributors to provide a flexible platform to examine time-series data sets typical in the movement sciences. The toolbox has previously been used to process and analyse walking, running, and ice hockey data sets, and can integrate existing routines, such as the KineMat toolbox, for additional analyses. The toolbox can help researchers and clinicians new to programming or biomechanics to process and analyze their data through a customizable workflow, while advanced users are encouraged to contribute additional functionality to the project. Students may benefit from using biomechZoo as a learning and research tool. It is hoped that the toolbox can play a role in advancing research in the movement sciences.

28263273,Hospital Administration and Nursing Leadership in Disasters: An Exploratory Study Using Concept Mapping.,"Strong leadership is critical in disaster situations when """"patient surge"""" challenges a hospital's capacity to respond and normally acceptable patterns of care are disrupted. Activation of the emergency operations plan triggers an incident command system structure for leadership decision making. Yet, implementation of the emergency operations plan and incident command system protocols is ultimately subject to nursing and hospital leadership at the service- and unit level. The results of these service-/unit-based leadership decisions have the potential to directly impact staff and patient safety, quality of care, and ultimately, patient outcomes. Despite the critical nature of these events, nurse leaders and administrators receive little education regarding leadership and decision making during disaster events. The purpose of this study is to identify essential competencies of nursing and hospital administrators' leadership during disaster events. An integrative mixed-methods design combining qualitative and quantitative approaches to data collection and analysis was used. Five focus groups were conducted with nurse leaders and hospital administrators at a large urban hospital in the Northeastern United States in a collaborative group process to generate relevant leadership competencies. Concept Systems Incorporated was used to sort, prioritize, and analyze the data (http://conceptsystemsinc.com/). The results suggest that participants' institutional knowledge (of existing resources, communications, processes) and prior disaster experience increase leadership competence.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28426817,Evaluation of machine learning algorithms and structural features for optimal MRI-based diagnostic prediction in psychosis.,"A relatively large number of studies have investigated the power of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data to discriminate patients with schizophrenia from healthy controls. However, very few of them have also included patients with bipolar disorder, allowing the clinically relevant discrimination between both psychotic diagnostics. To assess the efficacy of sMRI data for diagnostic prediction in psychosis we objectively evaluated the discriminative power of a wide range of commonly used machine learning algorithms (ridge, lasso, elastic net and L0 norm regularized logistic regressions, a support vector classifier, regularized discriminant analysis, random forests and a Gaussian process classifier) on main sMRI features including grey and white matter voxel-based morphometry (VBM), vertex-based cortical thickness and volume, region of interest volumetric measures and wavelet-based morphometry (WBM) maps. All possible combinations of algorithms and data features were considered in pairwise classifications of matched samples of healthy controls (N = 127), patients with schizophrenia (N = 128) and patients with bipolar disorder (N = 128). Results show that the selection of feature type is important, with grey matter VBM (without data reduction) delivering the best diagnostic prediction rates (averaging over classifiers: schizophrenia vs. healthy 75%, bipolar disorder vs. healthy 63% and schizophrenia vs. bipolar disorder 62%) whereas algorithms usually yielded very similar results. Indeed, those grey matter VBM accuracy rates were not even improved by combining all feature types in a single prediction model. Further multi-class classifications considering the three groups simultaneously made evident a lack of predictive power for the bipolar group, probably due to its intermediate anatomical features, located between those observed in healthy controls and those found in patients with schizophrenia. Finally, we provide MRIPredict (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mripredict/), a free tool for SPM, FSL and R, to easily carry out voxelwise predictions based on VBM images.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28444590,Transcripts of pectin-degrading enzymes and isolation of complete cDNA sequence of a pectate lyase gene induced by coffee white stem borer (Xylotrechus quadripes) in the bark tissue of Coffea canephora (robusta coffee).,"Of the two commercially cultivated coffee (Coffea) species, C. arabica (arabica) is highly susceptible and C. canephora (robusta) is highly resistant to the insect pest Xylotrechus quadripes (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), commonly known as coffee white stem borer (CWSB). We constructed a forward-subtracted cDNA library by Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH) from robusta bark tissue for profiling genes induced by CWSB infestation. Among the 265 unigenes of the SSH EST library, 7 unigenes (5 contigs and 2 singletons) matching different pectin-degrading enzymes were discovered. These ESTs matched one pectate lyase, three polygalacturonases, and one pectin acetylesterase gene. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that CWSB infestation strongly induces the pectate lyase gene at 72�h. Complete cDNA sequence of the pectate lyase gene was obtained through 3' and 5' RACE reactions. It was a 1595�bp long sequence that included full CDS and both UTRs. Against C. canephora genome sequences in Coffee Genome Hub database ( http://coffee-genome.org/ ), it had 22 matches to different pectate lyase genes mapped on 9 of the 11 pseudochromosomes, the top match being Cc07_g00190 Pectate lyase. In NCBI database, it matched pectate lyase sequences of several plants. Apart from C. canephora, the closest pectate lyase matches were from Sesamum indicum and Nicotiana tabacum. The pectinolytic enzymes discovered here are thought to play a role in the production of oligogalacturonides (OGs) which act as Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern (DAMP) signals eliciting innate immunity in plants. The pectate lyase gene, induced by CWSB infestation, along with other endogenous pectinolytic enzymes and CWSB-specific elicitors, may be involved in triggering basal defense responses to protect the CWSB-damaged tissue against pathogens, as well as to contain CWSB in robusta.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

28462382,GATA4 Is Sufficient to Establish Jejunal Versus Ileal Identity in the Small Intestine.,"<h4>Background & aims</h4>Patterning of the small intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis establishes three functionally distinct regions: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Efficient nutrient assimilation and growth depend on the proper spatial patterning of specialized digestive and absorptive functions performed by duodenal, jejunal, and ileal enterocytes. When enterocyte function is disrupted by disease or injury, intestinal failure can occur. One approach to alleviate intestinal failure would be to restore lost enterocyte functions. The molecular mechanisms determining regionally defined enterocyte functions, however, are poorly delineated. We previously showed that GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) is essential to define jejunal enterocytes. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that GATA4 is sufficient to confer jejunal identity within the intestinal epithelium.<h4>Methods</h4>To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel <i>Gata4</i> conditional knock-in mouse line and expressed GATA4 in the ileum, where it is absent.<h4>Results</h4>We found that GATA4-expressing ileum lost ileal identity. The global gene expression profile of GATA4-expressing ileal epithelium aligned more closely with jejunum and duodenum rather than ileum. Focusing on jejunal vs ileal identity, we defined sets of jejunal and ileal genes likely to be regulated directly by GATA4 to suppress ileal identity and promote jejunal identity. Furthermore, our study implicates GATA4 as a transcriptional repressor of <i>fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15)</i>, which encodes an enterokine that has been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, this study refines our understanding of an important GATA4-dependent molecular mechanism to pattern the intestinal epithelium along its cephalocaudal axis by elaborating on GATA4's function as a crucial dominant molecular determinant of jejunal enterocyte identity.

28472230,OMSim: a simulator for optical map data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The Bionano Genomics platform allows for the optical detection of short sequence patterns in very long DNA molecules (up to 2.5 Mbp). Molecules with overlapping patterns can be assembled to generate a consensus optical map of the entire genome. In turn, these optical maps can be used to validate or improve de novo genome assembly projects or to detect large-scale structural variation in genomes. Simulated optical map data can assist in the development and benchmarking of tools that operate on those data, such as alignment and assembly software. Additionally, it can help to optimize the experimental setup for a genome of interest. Such a simulator is currently not available.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a simulator, OMSim, that produces synthetic optical map data that mimics real Bionano Genomics data. These simulated data have been tested for compatibility with the Bionano Genomics Irys software system and the Irys-scaffolding scripts. OMSim is capable of handling very large genomes (over 30 Gbp) with high throughput and low memory requirements.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The Python simulation tool and a cross-platform graphical user interface are available as open source software under the GNU GPL v2 license ( http://www.bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be/omsim ).<h4>Contact</h4>jan.fostier@ugent.be.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28472263,A deep learning framework for improving long-range residue-residue contact prediction using a hierarchical strategy.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Residue-residue contacts are of great value for protein structure prediction, since contact information, especially from those long-range residue pairs, can significantly reduce the complexity of conformational sampling for protein structure prediction in practice. Despite progresses in the past decade on protein targets with abundant homologous sequences, accurate contact prediction for proteins with limited sequence information is still far from satisfaction. Methodologies for these hard targets still need further improvement.<h4>Results</h4>We presented a computational program DeepConPred, which includes a pipeline of two novel deep-learning-based methods (DeepCCon and DeepRCon) as well as a contact refinement step, to improve the prediction of long-range residue contacts from primary sequences. When compared with previous prediction approaches, our framework employed an effective scheme to identify optimal and important features for contact prediction, and was only trained with coevolutionary information derived from a limited number of homologous sequences to ensure robustness and usefulness for hard targets. Independent tests showed that 59.33%/49.97%, 64.39%/54.01% and 70.00%/59.81% of the top L/5, top L/10 and top 5 predictions were correct for CASP10/CASP11 proteins, respectively. In general, our algorithm ranked as one of the best methods for CASP targets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>All source data and codes are available at http://166.111.152.91/Downloads.html .<h4>Contact</h4>hgong@tsinghua.edu.cn or zengjy321@tsinghua.edu.cn.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28490512,Preconceptional and gestational weight trajectories and risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age baby in rural Gambia.,"<b>Background:</b> Maternal nutritional status is a key determinant of small for gestational age (SGA), but some knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding the role of the energy balance entering pregnancy.<b>Objective:</b> We investigated how preconceptional and gestational weight trajectories (summarized by individual-level traits) are associated with SGA risk in rural Gambia.<b>Design:</b> The sample comprised 670 women in a trial with serial weight data (7310 observations) that were available before and during pregnancy. Individual trajectories from 6 mo before conception to 30 wk of gestation were produced with the use of multilevel modeling. Summary traits were expressed as weight <i>z</i> scores [weight <i>z</i> score at 3 mo preconception (<i>z</i>wt<sub>-3 mo</sub>), weight <i>z</i> score at conception, weight <i>z</i> score at 3 mo postconception, weight <i>z</i> score at 7 mo postconception (<i>z</i>wt<sub>+7 mo</sub>), and conditional measures that represented the change from the preceding time] and were related to SGA risk with the use of Poisson regression with confounder adjustment; linear splines were used to account for nonlinearity.<b>Results:</b> Maternal weight at each time point had a consistent nonlinear relation with SGA risk. For example, the <i>z</i>wt<sub>-3 mo</sub> estimate was stronger in women with values =0.5 (RR: 0.736; 95% CI: 0.594, 0.910) than in women with values >0.5 (RR: 0.920; 95% CI: 0.682, 1.241). The former group had the highest observed SGA prevalence. Focusing on weight change, only conditional <i>z</i>wt<sub>+7 mo</sub> was associated with SGA and only in women with values >-0.5 (RR: 0.579; 95% CI: 0.463, 0.724).<b>Conclusions:</b> Protection against delivering an SGA neonate offered by greater preconceptional or gestational weight may be most pronounced in more undernourished and vulnerable women. Independent of this possibility, greater second- and third-trimester weight gain beyond a threshold may be protective.

28530006,Kindergarten/Elementary School Teachers and Web-based Oral Health-Related Resources: An Exploration.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The percentage of U.S. children with poor oral health continues to be high. Kindergarten/elementary school educators could play an important role in teaching students about oral health promotion. The objectives were to assess which oral health-related web-based resources teachers consider most helpful and how teachers' attitudes, knowledge, and behavioural intentions concerning oral health-related teaching change between before and after having access to a resource website.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Web-based survey data were collected from 95 kindergarten/elementary school educators before and after they accessed a website with oral health-related information for teachers (web-link: http://media.dent.umich.edu/teachoralhealth/index.html).<h4>Results</h4>Most teachers accessed lesson plans about 'Teeth and smiling' (90%) and 'Taking care of your teeth' (88%) and the fewest accessed information about 'Nutrition and health' (42%) and 'Information for parents' (39%). On average, all materials were perceived as useful (5-point scale with 5�=�'very useful', range�=�3.80 to 4.04). Responses to the question on how important dental health is for a child's ability to learn improved significantly from before to after the educational intervention (5-point scale with 5�=�'very important', 3.78 vs 4.44). Knowledge increased and behavioural intentions improved as well. The percentage of teachers who reported that they had included oral health-related material in the past was 47% and the percentage who intended to include it in the future was 65% (p�<�0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Providing kindergarten/elementary school educators with web-based resource materials improves their attitudes, increases their knowledge and leads to positive behavioural intentions concerning educating their students about oral health.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28579402,MIDAS: Mining differentially activated subpaths of KEGG pathways from multi-class RNA-seq data.,"Pathway based analysis of high throughput transcriptome data is a widely used approach to investigate biological mechanisms. Since a pathway consists of multiple functions, the recent approach is to determine condition specific sub-pathways or subpaths. However, there are several challenges. First, few existing methods utilize explicit gene expression information from RNA-seq. More importantly, subpath activity is usually an average of statistical scores, e.g., correlations, of edges in a candidate subpath, which fails to reflect gene expression quantity information. In addition, none of existing methods can handle multiple phenotypes. To address these technical problems, we designed and implemented an algorithm, MIDAS, that determines condition specific subpaths, each of which has different activities across multiple phenotypes. MIDAS utilizes gene expression quantity information fully and the network centrality information to determine condition specific subpaths. To test performance of our tool, we used TCGA breast cancer RNA-seq gene expression profiles with five molecular subtypes. 36 differentially activate subpaths were determined. The utility of our method, MIDAS, was demonstrated in four ways. All 36 subpaths are well supported by the literature information. Subsequently, we showed that these subpaths had a good discriminant power for five cancer subtype classification and also had a prognostic power in terms of survival analysis. Finally, in a performance comparison of MIDAS to a recent subpath prediction method, PATHOME, our method identified more subpaths and much more genes that are well supported by the literature information.<h4>Availability</h4>http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/MIDAS/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Endoparasitic specimens of E. nigrocorallium were found associated with three species of antipatharians on the Great Reef of Toliara. Individuals inhabit the gastrovascular ducts of their hosts and evidence of infestation is, most of the time, not visible externally. Phylogenetic analyses based on 18S rDNA, 16S rDNA and COI data indicate a close relation to Eenymeenymyzostoma cirripedium, the only other species of the genus. The morphology of E. nigrocorallium is very unusual compared to that of the more conventional E. cirripedium. The new species has five pairs of extremely reduced parapodia located on the body margin and no introvert, cirri or lateral organs. Individuals are hermaphroditic, with the male and female gonads both being located dorsally in the trunk. It also has a highly developed parenchymo-muscular layer on the ventral side, and the digestive system lies in the middle part of the trunk.

28698795,Semi-automated Modular Program Constructor for physiological modeling: Building cell and organ models.,"The Modular Program Constructor (MPC) is an open-source Java based modeling utility, built upon JSim's Mathematical Modeling Language (MML) ( http://www.physiome.org/jsim/) that uses directives embedded in model code to construct larger, more complicated models quickly and with less error than manually combining models. A major obstacle in writing complex models for physiological processes is the large amount of time it takes to model the myriad processes taking place simultaneously in cells, tissues, and organs. MPC replaces this task with code-generating algorithms that take model code from several different existing models and produce model code for a new JSim model. This is particularly useful during multi-scale model development where many variants are to be configured and tested against data. MPC encodes and preserves information about how a model is built from its simpler model modules, allowing the researcher to quickly substitute or update modules for hypothesis testing. MPC is implemented in Java and requires JSim to use its output. MPC source code and documentation are available at http://www.physiome.org/software/MPC/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28711973,PIWI-interacting RNAs as novel regulators of pancreatic beta cell function.,"<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>P-element induced Wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that interact with PIWI proteins and guide them to silence transposable elements. They are abundantly expressed in germline cells and play key roles in spermatogenesis. There is mounting evidence that piRNAs are also present in somatic cells, where they may accomplish additional regulatory tasks. The aim of this study was to identify the piRNAs expressed in pancreatic islets and to determine whether they are involved in the control of beta cell activities.<h4>Methods</h4>piRNA profiling of rat pancreatic islets was performed by microarray analysis. The functions of piRNAs were investigated by silencing the two main Piwi genes or by modulating the level of selected piRNAs in islet cells.<h4>Results</h4>We detected about 18,000 piRNAs in rat pancreatic islets, many of which were differentially expressed throughout islet postnatal development. Moreover, we identified changes in the level of several piRNAs in the islets of Goto-Kakizaki rats, a well-established animal model of type 2 diabetes. Silencing of Piwil2 or Piwil4 genes in adult rat islets caused a reduction in the level of several piRNAs and resulted in defective insulin secretion and increased resistance of the cells to cytokine-induced cell death. Furthermore, overexpression in the islets of control animals of two piRNAs that are upregulated in diabetic rats led to a selective defect in glucose-induced insulin release.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our results provide evidence for a role of PIWI proteins and their associated piRNAs in the control of beta cell functions, and suggest a possible involvement in the development of type 2 diabetes.<h4>Data availability</h4>Data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus repository under the accession number GSE93792.

28817627,Analysing researchers' outreach efforts and the association with publication metrics: A case study of Kudos.,"With the growth of scholarly collaboration networks and social communication platforms, members of the scholarly community are experimenting with their approach to disseminating research outputs, in an effort to increase their audience and outreach. However, from a researcher's point of view, it is difficult to determine whether efforts to make work more visible are worthwhile (in terms of the association with publication metrics) and within that, difficult to assess which platform or network is most effective for sharing work and connecting to a wider audience. We undertook a case study of Kudos (https://www.growkudos.com), a web-based service that claims to help researchers increase the outreach of their publications, to examine the most effective tools for sharing publications online, and to investigate which actions are associated with improved metrics. We extracted a dataset from Kudos of 830,565 unique publications claimed by authors, for which 20,775 had actions taken to explain or share via Kudos, and for 4,867 of these full text download data from publishers was available. Findings show that researchers are most likely to share their work on Facebook, but links shared on Twitter are more likely to be clicked on. A Mann-Whitney U test revealed that a treatment group (publications having actions in Kudos) had a significantly higher median average of 149 full text downloads (23.1% more) per publication as compared to a control group (having no actions in Kudos) with a median average of 121 full text downloads per publication. These findings suggest that performing actions on publications, such as sharing, explaining, or enriching, could help to increase the number of full text downloads of a publication.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource

We have investigated the in vivo pharmacology of a novel buprenorphine analogue, BU10119, for the first time.<h4>Experimental approach</h4>To determine the opioid pharmacology of BU10119 (0.3-3�mg�kg<sup>-1</sup> , i.p.) in vivo, the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay was applied in adult male CD1 mice. A range of behavioural paradigms was used to investigate the locomotor effects, rewarding properties and antidepressant or anxiolytic potential of BU10119. Additional groups of mice were exposed to a single (1�נ2�h) or repeated restraint stress (3� daily 2�h) to determine the ability of BU10119 to block stress-induced analgesia.<h4>Key results</h4>BU10119 alone was without any antinociceptive activity. BU10119 (1�mg�kg<sup>-1</sup> ) was able to block U50,488, buprenorphine and morphine-induced antinociception. The <U+03BA> antagonist effects of BU10119 in the tail-withdrawal assay reversed between 24 and 48�h. BU10119 was without significant locomotor or rewarding effects. BU10119 (1�mg�kg<sup>-1</sup> ) significantly reduced the latency to feed in the novelty-induced hypophagia task and reduced immobility time in the forced swim test, compared to saline-treated animals. There were no significant effects of BU10119 in either the elevated plus maze or the light-dark box. Both acute and repeated restraint stress-induced analgesia were blocked by pretreatment with BU10119 (1�mg�kg<sup>-1</sup> ). Parallel stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone were not affected.<h4>Conclusions and implications</h4>BU10119 is a mixed <U+03BA>/� receptor antagonist with relatively short-duration <U+03BA> antagonist activity. Based on these preclinical data, BU10119 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of depression and other stress-induced conditions.<h4>Linked articles</h4>This article is part of a themed section on Emerging Areas of Opioid Pharmacology.

28985876,The readability of psychosocial wellness patient resources: improving surgical outcomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>Patient education is increasingly accessed with online resources and is essential for patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes. The average American adult reads at a seventh grade level, and the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the American Medical Association (AMA) recommend that information be written at a sixth-grade reading level. Health literacy plays an important role in the disease course and outcomes of all patients, including those with depression and likely other psychiatric disorders, although this is an area in need of further study. The purpose of this study was to collect and analyze written, online mental health resources on the Veterans Health Administration (VA) website, and other websites, using readability assessment instruments.<h4>Methods</h4>An internet search was performed to identify written patient education information regarding mental health from the VA (the VA Mental Health Website) and top-rated psychiatric hospitals. Seven mental health topics were included in the analysis: generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and suicide. Readability analyses were performed using the Gunning Fog Index, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the Coleman-Liau Index, the SMOG Readability Formula, and the Automated Readability Index. These scores were then combined into a Readability Consensus score. A two-tailed t-test was used to compare the mean values, and statistical significance was set at P�<�0.05.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve of the best hospitals for psychiatry 2016-2017 were identified. Nine had educational material. Six of the nine cited the same resource, The StayWell Company, LLC (StayWell Company, LLC; Yardley, PA), for at least one of the mental health topics analyzed. The VA mental health website (http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov) had a significantly higher readability consensus than six of the top psychiatric hospitals (P�<�0.05, P�=�0.0067, P�=�0.019, P�=�0.041, P�=�0.0093, P�=�0.0054, and P�=�0.0093). The overall average readability consensus for mental health information on all websites analyzed was 9.52.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Online resources for mental health disorders are more complex than recommended by the NIH and AMA. Efforts to improve readability of mental health and psychosocial wellness resources could benefit patient understanding and outcomes, especially in patients with lower literacy. Surgical outcomes are correlated with patient mental health and psychosocial wellness and thus can be improved with more appropriate levels of readability of psychosocial wellness resources.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

While knowledgebases play an increasingly important role in the scientific community, their ability to keep up with the growth of biomedical literature is under scrutiny. Using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as a case study, we address this concern via multiple literature triage approaches. Results:With the assistance of the PubTator text-mining tool, we tagged more than 10 000 articles to assess the ratio of papers relevant for curation. We first show that curators read and evaluate many more papers than they curate, and that measuring the number of curated publications is insufficient to provide a complete picture as demonstrated by the fact that 8000-10 000 papers are curated in UniProt each year while curators evaluate 50 000-70 000 papers per year. We show that 90% of the papers in PubMed are out of the scope of UniProt, that a maximum of 2-3% of the papers indexed in PubMed each year are relevant for UniProt curation, and that, despite appearances, expert curation in UniProt is scalable.

In addition, tracking animal movements is appealing to naturalists, citizen scientists, and the general public and thus represents a tool for public engagement in science and science education. Although a useful tool, the large amount of data collected using RFID may quickly become overwhelming. Here, we present an R package (feedr) we have developed for loading, transforming, and visualizing time-stamped, georeferenced data, such as RFID data collected from static logger stations. Using our package, data can be transformed from raw RFID data to visits, presence (regular detections by a logger over time), movements between loggers, displacements, and activity patterns. In addition, we provide several conversion functions to allow users to format data for use in functions from other complementary R packages. Data can also be visualized through static or interactive maps or as animations over time. To increase accessibility, data can be transformed and visualized either through R directly, or through the companion site: http://animalnexus.ca, an online, user-friendly, R-based Shiny Web application. This system can be used by professional and citizen scientists alike to view and study animal movements. We have designed this package to be flexible and to be able to handle data collected from other stationary sources (e.g., hair traps, static very high frequency (VHF) telemetry loggers, observations of marked individuals in colonies or staging sites), and we hope this framework will become a meeting point for science, education, and community awareness of the movements of animals.

WFSA; 2014 http://wfsa.newsweaver.com/Newsletter/p8c8ta4ri7a1wsacct9y3u?a=2&p=47730565&t=27996496 ). In spite of this evidence, factors contributing to maternal mortality related to anaesthesia in LMICs and the magnitude of these issues have not been comprehensively studied. We therefore set out to assess regional referral, district, private for profit and private not-for profit hospitals in Uganda.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional survey at 64 government and private hospitals in Uganda using pre-set questionnaires to the anaesthetists and hospital directors. Access to the minimum requirements for safe obstetric anaesthesia according to WFSA guidelines were also checked using a checklist for operating and recovery rooms.<h4>Results</h4>Response rate was 100% following personal interviews of anaesthetists, and hospital directors. Only 3 of the 64 (5%) of the hospitals had all requirements available to meet the WFSA International guidelines for safe anaesthesia. Additionally, 54/64 (84%) did not have a trained physician anaesthetist and 5/64 (8%) had no trained providers for anaesthesia at all. Frequent shortages of drugs were reported for regional/neuroaxial anaesthesia, and other essential drugs were often lacking such as antacids and antihypertensives. We noted that many of the anaesthesia machines present were obsolete models without functional safety alarms and/or mechanical ventilators. Continuous ECG was only available in 3/64 (5%) of hospitals.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We conclude that there is a significant lack of essential equipment for the delivery of safe anaesthesia across this region. This is compounded by the shortage of trained providers and inadequate supervision. It is therefore essential to strengthen anaesthesia services by addressing these specific deficiencies. This will include improved training of associate clinicians, training more physician anaesthetists and providing the basic equipment required to provide safe and effective care. These services are key components of comprehensive emergency obstetric care and anaesthetists are crucial in managing critically ill mothers and ensuring good surgical outcomes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29178193,Proteomic Characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans Larval Development.,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is widely used as a model organism to study cell and developmental biology. Quantitative proteomics of C. elegans is still in its infancy and, so far, most studies have been performed on adult worm samples. Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to characterize protein level changes across the four larval developmental stages (L1-L4) of C. elegans. In total, we identified 4130 proteins, and quantified 1541 proteins that were present across all four stages in three biological replicates from independent experiments. Using hierarchical clustering and functional ontological analyses, we identified 21 clusters containing proteins with similar protein profiles across the four stages, and highlighted the most overrepresented biological functions in each of these protein clusters. In addition, we used the dataset to identify putative larval stage-specific proteins in each individual developmental stage, as well as in the early and late developmental stages. In summary, this dataset provides system-wide analysis of protein level changes across the four C. elegans larval developmental stages, which serves as a useful resource for the C. elegans research community. MS data were deposited in ProteomeXchange (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the PRIDE partner repository with the primary accession identifier PXD006676.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29202050,One Size Doesn't Fit All: Measuring Individual Privacy in Aggregate Genomic Data.,"Even in the aggregate, genomic data can reveal sensitive information about individuals. We present a new model-based measure, PrivMAF, that provides provable privacy guarantees for aggregate data (namely minor allele frequencies) obtained from genomic studies. Unlike many previous measures that have been designed to measure the total privacy lost by all participants in a study, PrivMAF gives an individual privacy measure for each participant in the study, not just an average measure. These individual measures can then be combined to measure the worst case privacy loss in the study. Our measure also allows us to quantify the privacy gains achieved by perturbing the data, either by adding noise or binning. Our findings demonstrate that both perturbation approaches offer significant privacy gains. Moreover, we see that these privacy gains can be achieved while minimizing perturbation (and thus maximizing the utility) relative to stricter notions of privacy, such as differential privacy. We test PrivMAF using genotype data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, providing a more nuanced understanding of the privacy risks involved in an actual genome-wide association studies. Interestingly, our analysis demonstrates that the privacy implications of releasing MAFs from a study can differ greatly from individual to individual. An implementation of our method is available at http://privmaf.csail.mit.edu.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Comparing to the other state-of-the-art alignment-free comparison methods, K2 demonstrates competitive performance in generating the phylogenetic tree, in evaluating functionally related regulatory sequences, and in computing the edit distance (similarity/dissimilarity) between sequences. Furthermore, the K2 approach is much faster than the other methods. An improved method, K2*, is also proposed, which is able to determine the appropriate algorithmic parameter (length) automatically, without first considering different values. Comparative analysis with the state-of-the-art alignment-free sequence similarity methods demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approaches, especially with increasing sequence length, or increasing dataset sizes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The K2 and K2* approaches are implemented in the R language as a package and is freely available for open access (http://community.wvu.edu/daadjeroh/projects/K2/K2_1.0.tar.gz).<h4>Contact</h4>yueljiang@163.com.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29280994,PRAPI: post-transcriptional regulation analysis pipeline for Iso-Seq.,"<h4>Summary</h4>The single-molecule real-time (SMRT) isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) based on Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) platform has received increasing attention for its ability to explore full-length isoforms. Thus, comprehensive tools for Iso-Seq bioinformatics analysis are extremely useful. Here, we present a one-stop solution for Iso-Seq analysis, called PRAPI to analyze alternative transcription initiation (ATI), alternative splicing (AS), alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA), natural antisense transcripts (NAT), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) comprehensively. PRAPI is capable of combining Iso-Seq full-length isoforms with short read data, such as RNA-Seq or polyadenylation site sequencing (PAS-seq) for differential expression analysis of NAT, AS, APA and circRNAs. Furthermore, PRAPI can annotate new genes and correct mis-annotated genes when gene annotation is available. Finally, PRAPI generates high-quality vector graphics to visualize and highlight the Iso-Seq results.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The Dockerfile of PRAPI is available at http://www.bioinfor.org/tool/PRAPI.<h4>Contact</h4>lfgu@fafu.edu.cn.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29512488,S2P: A software tool to quickly carry out reproducible biomedical research projects involving 2D-gel and MALDI-TOF MS protein data.,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>2D-gel electrophoresis is widely used in combination with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in order to analyze the proteome of biological samples. For instance, it can be used to discover proteins that are differentially expressed between two groups (e.g. two disease conditions, case vs. control, etc.) thus obtaining a set of potential biomarkers. This procedure requires a great deal of data processing in order to prepare data for analysis or to merge and integrate data from different sources. This kind of work is usually done manually (e.g. copying and pasting data into spreadsheet files), which is highly time consuming and distracts the researcher from other important, core tasks. Moreover, engaging in a repetitive process in a non-automated, handling-based manner is prone to error, thus threatening reliability and reproducibility. The objective of this paper is to present S2P, an open source software to overcome these drawbacks.<h4>Methods</h4>S2P is implemented in Java on top of the AIBench framework, and relies on well-established open source libraries to accomplish different tasks.<h4>Results</h4>S2P is an AIBench based desktop multiplatform application, specifically aimed to process 2D-gel and MALDI-mass spectrometry protein identification-based data in a computer-aided, reproducible manner. Different case studies are presented in order to show the usefulness of S2P.<h4>Conclusions</h4>S2P is open source and free to all users at http://www.sing-group.org/s2p. Through its user-friendly GUI interface, S2P dramatically reduces the time that researchers need to invest in order to prepare data for analysis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29519778,Outcome of Critically ill Patients Undergoing Mandatory Insulin Therapy Compared to Usual Care Insulin Therapy: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Observational and interventional studies in patients with both acute medical conditions and long-standing diabetes have shown that improved blood glucose control confers a survival advantage or reduces complication rates. Policies of """"tight"""" glycaemic control were rapidly adopted by many general intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide in the mid 00's, even though the results of the studies were not generalizable to mixed medical/surgical ICUs with different intravenous feeding policies. OBJECTIVE:The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety of mandatory insulin infusion in critically ill patients in a general ICU setting. METHODS:This protocol summarizes the rationale and design of a randomized, controlled, single-center trial investigating the effect of mandatory insulin therapy versus usual care insulin therapy for those patients admitted for a stay of longer than 48 hours. In total, 109 critically ill adults predicted to stay in intensive care for longer than 48 hours consented. The primary outcome is to determine the safety of mandatory insulin therapy in critically ill patients using the number of episodes of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia per unit length of stay in intensive care. Secondary outcomes include the duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU and hospital stay, hospital mortality, and measures of renal, hepatic, and haematological dysfunction. RESULTS:The project was funded in 2005 and enrolment was completed 2007. Data analysis is currently underway and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2018. CONCLUSIONS:This protocol for a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of mandatory insulin therapy should provide an answer to a key question for the management of patients in the ICU and ultimately improving outcome.

Here, we use the rise of multidrug-resistant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> in a German neurorehabilitation center from April 2015 to April 2016 to dissect the benefit of whole genome sequencing (WGS) for outbreak analyses. In total, 53 isolates were obtained from 52 patients and examined using WGS. Two independent analysis strategies (reference-based and -free) revealed the same distinct clusters of two CTX-M-15 producing <i>K. pneumoniae</i> clones (ST15, <i>n</i> = 31; ST405, <i>n</i> = 7) and one CTX-M-15 producing <i>Klebsiella quasipneumoniae</i> strain (ST414, <i>n</i> = 8). Additionally, we determined sequence variations associated with antimicrobial resistance phenotypes in single isolates expressing carbapenem and colistin resistance, respectively. For rapid detection of the major <i>K. pneumoniae</i> outbreak clone (ST15), a selective triplex PCR was deduced from WGS data of the major outbreak strain and <i>K. pneumoniae</i> genome data deposited in central databases. Moreover, we introduce two novel open-source applications supporting reference genome selection (<i>refRank</i>; https://gitlab.com/s.fuchs/refRank) and alignment-based SNP-filtering (<i>SNPfilter</i>; https://gitlab.com/s.fuchs/snpfilter) in NGS analyses.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29530061,Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis in response to glucose by suppressing PTEN.,"BACKGROUND:Diabetic patients have a higher risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the main enzyme responsible for producing monounsaturated fatty acids(MUFA) from saturated fatty acids, is frequently deregulated in both diabetes and CRC. The function and mechanism of SCD1 in metastasis of CRC and its relevance to glucose remains largely unknown. METHODS:SCD1 expression levels were analyzed in human CRC tissues and the Cancer Browser database ( https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/ ). CRC cell lines stably transfected with SCD1 shRNAs or vector were established to investigate the role of SCD1 in modulating migration and invasion of CRC cells. A glucose concentration gradient was set to investigate regulation of SCD1 in CRC relevant to diabetic conditions. RESULTS:The clinical data analysis showed high expression of SCD1 in CRC tissues with a negative correlation with the prognosis of CRC. In vitro experiments revealed that SCD1 increased CRC progression through promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Lipidomic analysis demonstrated that SCD1 increased MUFA levels and MUFA administration could rescue migration and invasion defect of CRC cells induced by SCD1 knockdown. Furthermore, SCD1-mediated progression of CRC was promoted by carbohydrate response-element binding protein (ChREBP) in response to high glucose. Mechanistically, hyperglycemia-SCD1-MUFA induced CRC cell migration and invasion by regulating PTEN. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings show that SCD1 promotes metastasis of CRC cells through MUFA production and suppressing PTEN in response to glucose, which may be a novel mechanism for diabetes-induced CRC metastasis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

29572201,"Investigating the Impact of Hearing Aid Use and Auditory Training on Cognition, Depressive Symptoms, and Social Interaction in Adults With Hearing Loss: Protocol for a Crossover Trial.","BACKGROUND:Sensorineural hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit among older adults. Some of the psychosocial consequences of this condition include difficulty in understanding speech, depression, and social isolation. Studies have shown that older adults with hearing loss show some age-related cognitive decline. Hearing aids have been proven as successful interventions to alleviate sensorineural hearing loss. In addition to hearing aid use, the positive effects of auditory training-formal listening activities designed to optimize speech perception-are now being documented among adults with hearing loss who use hearing aids, especially new hearing aid users. Auditory training has also been shown to produce prolonged cognitive performance improvements. However, there is still little evidence to support the benefits of simultaneous hearing aid use and individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognitive performance in adults with hearing loss. OBJECTIVE:This study will investigate whether using hearing aids for the first time will improve the impact of individualized face-to-face auditory training on cognition, depression, and social interaction for adults with sensorineural hearing loss. The rationale for this study is based on the hypothesis that, in adults with sensorineural hearing loss, using hearing aids for the first time in combination with individualized face-to-face auditory training will be more effective for improving cognition, depressive symptoms, and social interaction rather than auditory training on its own. METHODS:This is a crossover trial targeting 40 men and women between 50 and 90 years of age with either mild or moderate symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. Consented, willing participants will be recruited from either an independent living accommodation or via a community database to undergo a 6-month intensive face-to-face auditory training program (active control). Participants will be assigned in random order to receive hearing aid (intervention) for either the first 3 or last 3 months of the 6-month auditory training program. Each participant will be tested at baseline, 3, and 6 months using a neuropsychological battery of computer-based cognitive assessments, together with a depression symptom instrument and a social interaction measure. The primary outcome will be cognitive performance with regard to spatial working memory. Secondary outcome measures include other cognition performance measures, depressive symptoms, social interaction, and hearing satisfaction. RESULTS:Data analysis is currently under way and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in June 2018. CONCLUSIONS:Results from the study will inform strategies for aural rehabilitation, hearing aid delivery, and future hearing loss intervention trials.

Online miRNA database (http://www.bioguo.org) was utilized to explore gene polymorphism in MMP9 3'UTR that might break the interaction between MMP9 and miRNA. Luciferase assay was utilized to confirm the miRNA targeted MMP9. Real-time PCR, western�blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were carried out to understand the roles of MMP9 in PU as well as how rs1056629 in MMP9 3'UTR compromises the interaction between MMP9 and miR-491. rs1056629 in MMP9 3'UTR that compromised the interaction between MMP9 and four miRNAs including miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941, and only miR-491 among miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 decreased luciferase activity of wild-type MMP9 3'UTR, and luciferase activities of mutant-3 and mutant-4 MMP9 3'UTR in miR-491 overexpressing cells was comparable with scramble control. miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 levels in PU group was comparable with healthy control, and miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 in subjects carrying AA genotype was similar with those in AC and CC groups. MMP9 mRNA and protein, and histology score in subjects with PU were much higher, and were also much higher in AA group. Only miR-491 mimic among miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 mimics downregulated the MMP9 level, and only miR-491 inhibitor among miR-194-3p, miR-491, miR-1915-3p and miR-941 inhibitors upregulated the MMP9 level.

We measured traits reported by parents and teachers as well as the child's performance on tests that evaluate the ability to use facial expressions to recognize the mental state of others at 7, 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, and 14 years of age.<h4>Results</h4>Prenatal DAPs were associated with poorer parent and teacher reported social behavior [e.g., a 10-fold DAP increase was associated with a 2.7-point increase (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.9, 4.5) in parent-reported Social Responsiveness Scale, Version 2, T-scores at age 14]. We did not find clear evidence of associations between residential proximity to OP use during pregnancy and ASD-related traits.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These findings contribute mixed evidence linking OP pesticide exposures with traits related to developmental disorders like ASD. Subtle pesticide-related effects on ASD-related traits among a population with ubiquitous exposure could result in a rise in cases of clinically diagnosed disorders like ASD. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2580.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29703719,Sialic Acid Blockade Suppresses Tumor Growth by Enhancing T-cell-Mediated Tumor Immunity.,"Sialic acid sugars on the surface of cancer cells have emerged as potent immune modulators that contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment and tumor immune evasion. However, the mechanisms by which these sugars modulate antitumor immunity as well as therapeutic strategies directed against them are limited. Here we report that intratumoral injections with a sialic acid mimetic Ac<sub>5</sub>3F<sub>ax</sub>Neu5Ac block tumor sialic acid expression <i>in vivo</i> and suppress tumor growth in multiple tumor models. Sialic acid blockade had a major impact on the immune cell composition of the tumor, enhancing tumor-infiltrating natural killer cell and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers while reducing regulatory T-cell and myeloid regulatory cell numbers. Sialic acid blockade enhanced cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells in part by facilitating antigen-specific T-cell-tumor cell clustering. Sialic acid blockade also synergized with adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <i>in vivo</i> and enhanced CpG immune adjuvant therapy by increasing dendritic cell activation and subsequent CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Collectively, these data emphasize the crucial role of sialic acids in tumor immune evasion and provide proof of concept that sialic acid blockade creates an immune-permissive tumor microenvironment for CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-mediated tumor immunity, either as single treatment or in combination with other immune-based intervention strategies.<b>Significance:</b> Sialic acid sugars function as important modulators of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that limit potent antitumor immunity.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/13/3574/F1.large.jpg <i>Cancer Res; 78(13); 3574-88. �2018 AACR</i>.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29743730,Evaluating soil moisture retrievals from ESA's SMOS and NASA's SMAP brightness temperature datasets.,"Two satellites are currently monitoring surface soil moisture (SM) using L-band observations: SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), a joint ESA (European Space Agency), CNES (Centre national d'�tudes spatiales), and CDTI (the Spanish government agency with responsibility for space) satellite launched on November 2, 2009 and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive), a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) satellite successfully launched in January 2015. In this study, we used a multilinear regression approach to retrieve SM from SMAP data to create a global dataset of SM, which is consistent with SM data retrieved from SMOS. This was achieved by calibrating coefficients of the regression model using the CATDS (Centre Aval de Traitement des Donn�es) SMOS Level 3 SM and the horizontally and vertically polarized brightness temperatures (TB) at 40� incidence angle, over the 2013 - 2014 period. Next, this model was applied to SMAP L3 TB data from Apr 2015 to Jul 2016. The retrieved SM from SMAP (referred to here as SMAP_Reg) was compared to: (i) the operational SMAP L3 SM (SMAP_SCA), retrieved using the baseline Single Channel retrieval Algorithm (SCA); and (ii) the operational SMOSL3 SM, derived from the multiangular inversion of the L-MEB model (L-MEB algorithm) (SMOSL3). This inter-comparison was made against <i>in situ</i> soil moisture measurements from more than 400 sites spread over the globe, which are used here as a reference soil moisture dataset. The <i>in situ</i> observations were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/) in North of America (PBO_H2O, SCAN, SNOTEL, iRON, and USCRN), in Australia (Oznet), Africa (DAHRA), and in Europe (REMEDHUS, SMOSMANIA, FMI, and RSMN). The agreement was analyzed in terms of four classical statistical criteria: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Unbiased RMSE (UnbRMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Results of the comparison of these various products with <i>in situ</i> observations show that the performance of both SMAP products i.e. SMAP_SCA and SMAP_Reg is similar and marginally better to that of the SMOSL3 product particularly over the PBO_H2O, SCAN, and USCRN sites. However, SMOSL3 SM was closer to the <i>in situ</i> observations over the DAHRA and Oznet sites. We found that the correlation between all three datasets and <i>in situ</i> measurements is best (R > 0.80) over the Oznet sites and worst (R = 0.58) over the SNOTEL sites for SMAP_SCA and over the DAHRA and SMOSMANIA sites (R= 0.51 and R= 0.45 for SMAP_Reg and SMOSL3, respectively). The Bias values showed that all products are generally dry, except over RSMN, DAHRA, and Oznet (and FMI for SMAP_SCA). Finally, our analysis provided interesting insights that can be useful to improve the consistency between SMAP and SMOS datasets.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Exploration of allostery has thus been regarded as a crucial requirement for research on biological mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutics. Here, based on our previously developed allosteric data and methods, we present an interactive platform called AlloFinder that identifies potential endogenous or exogenous allosteric modulators and their involvement in human allosterome. AlloFinder automatically amalgamates allosteric site identification, allosteric screening and allosteric scoring evaluation of modulator-protein complexes to identify allosteric modulators, followed by allosterome mapping analyses of predicted allosteric sites and modulators in human proteome. This web server exhibits prominent performance in the reemergence of allosteric metabolites and exogenous allosteric modulators in known allosteric proteins. Specifically, AlloFinder enables identification of allosteric metabolites for metabolic enzymes and screening of potential allosteric compounds for disease-related targets. Significantly, the feasibility of AlloFinder to discover allosteric modulators was tested in a real case of signal transduction and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) and validated by mutagenesis and functional experiments. Collectively, AlloFinder is expected to contribute to exploration of the mechanisms of allosteric regulation between metabolites and metabolic enzymes, and to accelerate allosteric drug discovery.

AAI-profiler summarizes proteome-wide sequence search results to identify novel species, assess the need for taxonomic reclassification and detect multi-isolate and contaminated samples. AAI-profiler visualises results using a scatterplot that shows the Average Amino-acid Identity (AAI) from the query proteome to all similar species in the sequence database. Taxonomic groups are indicated by colour and marker styles, making outliers easy to spot. AAI-profiler uses SANSparallel to perform high-performance homology searches, making proteome-wide analysis possible. We demonstrate the efficacy of AAI-profiler in the discovery of a close relationship between two bacterial symbionts of an omnivorous pirate bug (Orius) and a thrip (Frankliniella occidentalis), an important pest in agriculture. The symbionts represent novel species within the genus Rosenbergiella so far described only in floral nectar. AAI-profiler is easy to use, the analysis presented only required two mouse clicks and was completed in a few minutes. AAI-profiler is available at http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/AAI.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29775639,Surgical Management of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Attributed to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: AUA Guideline.,"PURPOSE:Male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common in men and can have negative effects on quality of life (QoL). It is the hope that this Guideline becomes a reference on the effective evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH. MATERIALS AND METHODS:The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) database to identify studies indexed between January 2007 and September 2017. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/). RESULTS:This Guideline provides updated, evidence-based recommendations regarding management of LUTS/BPH utilizing surgery and minimally invasive surgical therapies; additional statements are made regarding diagnostic and pre-operative tests. Clinical statements are made in comparison to what is generally accepted as the gold standard (i.e. transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP]-monopolar and/or bipolar). This guideline is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm. CONCLUSIONS:The prevalence and the severity of LUTS increases as men age and is an important diagnosis in the healthcare of patients and the welfare of society. This document will undergo additional literature reviews and updating as the knowledge regarding current treatments and future surgical options continues to expand.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29804401,[Analysis of significant microRNA associated with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension].,"Objective: To find key microRNA (miR) associated with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Methods: Affymetrix miR microarray data and GSE56914 data downloaded from GEO database (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) were obtained and integrated. The microarray data were obtained from peripheral blood samples of CTEPH patients and the matched control. Differentially expressed miRs were screened. Target genes of these miRs were searched. Then, functional enrichment analyses for these miRs were performed. After that, disease network including miRs, target genes and pathways was constructed. Results: Five important miRs including hsa-miR-885-5p, hsa-miR-501-5p, hsa-miR-615-3p, hsa-miR-610, and hsa-miR-346 were identified. Furthermore, hsa-miR-885-5p and hsa-miR-501-5p were significantly enriched in cell cycle pathway. Hsa-miR-615-3p was involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, axon guidance, focal adhesion and cell cycle pathway. Hsa-miR-610 was significantly enriched in focal adhesion pathway, and hsa-miR-346 was involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, axon guidance, and focal adhesion pathway. Conclusions: Hsa-miR-885-5p, hsa-miR-501-5p, hsa-miR-615-3p, hsa-miR-610 and hsa-miR-346 are important miRs for the development of CTEPH.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29806693,Neuronal calcineurin transcriptional targets parallel changes observed in Alzheimer disease brain.,"Synaptic dysfunction and loss are core pathological features in Alzheimer disease (AD). In the vicinity of amyloid-� plaques in animal models, synaptic toxicity occurs and is associated with chronic activation of the phosphatase calcineurin (CN). Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of CN blocks amyloid-� synaptotoxicity. We therefore hypothesized that CN-mediated transcriptional changes may contribute to AD neuropathology and tested this by examining the impact of CN over-expression on neuronal gene expression in�vivo. We found dramatic transcriptional down-regulation, especially of synaptic mRNAs, in neurons chronically exposed to CN activation. Importantly, the transcriptional profile parallels the changes in human AD tissue. Bioinformatics analyses suggest that both nuclear factor of activated T cells and numerous microRNAs may all be impacted by CN, and�parallel findings are observed in AD. These data and analyses support the hypothesis that at least part of the synaptic failure characterizing AD may result from aberrant CN activation leading to down-regulation of synaptic genes, potentially via activation of specific transcription factors and expression of repressive microRNAs.<h4>Open practices</h4>Open Science: This manuscript was awarded with the Open Materials Badge.

29843602,"Combining RNA-seq data and homology-based gene prediction for plants, animals and fungi.","<h4>Background</h4>Genome annotation is of key importance in many research questions. The identification of protein-coding genes is often based on transcriptome sequencing data, ab-initio or homology-based prediction. Recently, it was demonstrated that intron position conservation improves homology-based gene prediction, and that experimental data improves ab-initio gene prediction.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present an extension of the gene prediction program GeMoMa that utilizes amino acid sequence conservation, intron position conservation and optionally RNA-seq data for homology-based gene prediction. We show on published benchmark data for plants, animals and fungi that GeMoMa performs better than the gene prediction programs BRAKER1, MAKER2, and CodingQuarry, and purely RNA-seq-based pipelines for transcript identification. In addition, we demonstrate that using multiple reference organisms may help to further improve the performance of GeMoMa. Finally, we apply GeMoMa to four nematode species and to the recently published barley reference genome indicating that current annotations of protein-coding genes may be refined using GeMoMa predictions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>GeMoMa might be of great utility for annotating newly sequenced genomes but also for finding homologs of a specific gene or gene family.

29956198,Prognostic Impact of Extracapsular Lymph Node Invasion on Survival in Non-small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"The extracapsular tumor extension (ECE) of nodal metastasis is an important prognostic factor in different types of malignancies. However, there is a lack of recent data in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, the TNM staging system does not include ECE status as a prognostic factor. This systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to summarize and pool existing data to determine the prognostic role of ECE in patients with lymph node-positive NSCLC. Two authors performed an independent search in PubMed using a predefined keyword list, without language restrictions with publication date since 1990. Prospective or retrospective studies reporting data on prognostic parameters in subjects with NSCLC with positive ECE or with only intracapsular lymph node metastasis were retrieved. Data were summarized using risk ratios (RR) for the survival with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data was analyzed using Mix 2 (ref: Bax L: MIX 2.0 - Professional software for meta-analysis in Excel. Version 2.015. BiostatXL, 2016. https://www.meta-analysis-made-easy.com ). There 2,105 studies were reviewed. Five studies covering a total of 828 subjects met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Two hundred and ninety-eight (35.9%) patients were categorized as ECE+, of whom 54 (18.1%) survived at the end of follow-up. In the ECE-negative group, 257 patients (48.4%) survived by the end of follow-up. Thus, ECE status is associated with a significantly decreased survival rate: pooled RR 0.45 (95% CI 0.35-0.59), Q <sub>(4)</sub>�=�4.06, P <sub>value</sub>�=�0.39, and I <sup>2</sup>�=�68.00% (95 CI 0.00-79.55%). In conclusion, ECE has a significant impact on survival in NSCLC patients and should be considered in diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in addition to the current TNM staging. Postoperative radiotherapy may be an option in ECE-positive pN1 NSCLC patients.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

We developed the Phenotype Execution and Modeling Architecture (PhEMA, http://projectphema.org) to author and execute standardized computable phenotype algorithms. With PhEMA, we converted an algorithm for benign prostatic hyperplasia, developed for the electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE), into a standards-based computable format. Eight sites (7 within eMERGE) received the computable algorithm, and 6 successfully executed it against local data warehouses and/or i2b2 instances. Blinded random chart review of cases selected by the computable algorithm shows PPV =90%, and 3 out of 5 sites had >90% overlap of selected cases when comparing the computable algorithm to their original eMERGE implementation. This case study demonstrates potential use of PhEMA computable representations to automate phenotyping across different EHR systems, but also highlights some ongoing challenges.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Our data analyses confirmed that the support vector machine with Iterative Single Data Algorithm showed the best performance in prediction of future development of AD from the prodromal stage (mild cognitive impairment), and that it was also sensitive to other types of dementia such as Parkinson's Disease Dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and that perfusion imaging using single photon emission computed tomography may achieve a similar accuracy to that of FDG-PET.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,clinical
30200994,TAP: a targeted clinical genomics pipeline for detecting transcript variants using RNA-seq data.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA-seq is a powerful and cost-effective technology for molecular diagnostics of cancer and other diseases, and it can reach its full potential when coupled with validated clinical-grade informatics tools. Despite recent advances in long-read sequencing, transcriptome assembly of short reads remains a useful and cost-effective methodology for unveiling transcript-level rearrangements and novel isoforms. One of the major concerns for adopting the proven de novo assembly approach for RNA-seq data in clinical settings has been the analysis turnaround time. To address this concern, we have developed a targeted approach to expedite assembly and analysis of RNA-seq data.<h4>Results</h4>Here we present our Targeted Assembly Pipeline (TAP), which consists of four stages: 1) alignment-free gene-level classification of RNA-seq reads using BioBloomTools, 2) de novo assembly of individual targets using Trans-ABySS, 3) alignment of assembled contigs to the reference genome and transcriptome with GMAP and BWA and 4) structural and splicing variant detection using PAVFinder. We show that PAVFinder is a robust gene fusion detection tool when compared to established methods such as Tophat-Fusion and deFuse on simulated data of 448 events. Using the Leucegene acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq data and a set of 580 COSMIC target genes, TAP identified a wide range of hallmark molecular anomalies including gene fusions, tandem duplications, insertions and deletions in agreement with published literature results. Moreover, also in this dataset, TAP captured AML-specific splicing variants such as skipped exons and novel splice sites reported in studies elsewhere. Running time of TAP on 100-150 million read pairs and a 580-gene set is one to 2 hours on a 48-core machine.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We demonstrated that TAP is a fast and robust RNA-seq variant detection pipeline that is potentially amenable to clinical applications.

Through their 3' untranslated regions, protein-coding RNAs interact with RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, which regulate many properties, including RNA stability and subcellular localization. We developed the terminal exon characterization (TEC) tool ( http://tectool.unibas.ch ), which can be used with RNA-sequencing data from any species for which a genome annotation that includes sites of RNA cleavage and polyadenylation is available. We discovered hundreds of previously unknown isoforms and cell-type-specific terminal exons in human cells. Ribosome profiling data revealed that many of these isoforms were translated. By applying TECtool to single-cell sequencing data, we found that the newly identified isoforms were expressed in subpopulations of cells. Thus, TECtool enables the identification of previously unknown isoforms in well-studied cell systems and in rare cell types.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

It contributes to research on spatio-temporal variation in the wider determinants of health, exploring how the lifecourse of places relates to socio-geographical inequalities in health outcomes for individuals. This study also contributes to the renewed research focus on the links between labour market trends and population health, prompted by the recent global economic recession. We report research using the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), a 5.3% representative sample of the Scottish population, derived from census data (https://sls.lscs.ac.uk/). In Scotland, (2011) census data include self-reported mental health. SLS data were combined with non-disclosive information from other sources, including spatio-temporal trends in labour market conditions (calculated using trajectory modelling) in the 32 local authority areas in Scotland. We show that, for groups of local authorities in Scotland over the period 2007-2011, trends in employment varied. These geographically variable trends in employment rates were associated with inequalities in self-reported mental health across the country, after controlling for a number of other individual and neighbourhood risk factors. For residents of regions that had experienced relatively high and stable levels of employment the odds ratio for reporting a mental illness was significantly lower than for the 'reference group', living in areas with persistently low employment rates. In areas where employment declined markedly from higher levels, the odds ratio was similar to the reference group. The findings emphasise how changes in local economic conditions may influence people's health and wellbeing independently of their own employment status. We conclude that, during the recent recession, the economic life course of places across Scotland has been associated with individual mental health outcomes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30239574,A clustering linear combination approach to jointly analyze multiple phenotypes for GWAS.,"<h4>Summary</h4>There is an increasing interest in joint analysis of multiple phenotypes for genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on the following reasons. First, cohorts usually collect multiple phenotypes and complex diseases are usually measured by multiple correlated intermediate phenotypes. Second, jointly analyzing multiple phenotypes may increase statistical power for detecting genetic variants associated with complex diseases. Third, there is increasing evidence showing that pleiotropy is a widespread phenomenon in complex diseases. In this paper, we develop a clustering linear combination (CLC) method to jointly analyze multiple phenotypes for GWASs. In the CLC method, we first cluster individual statistics into positively correlated clusters and then, combine the individual statistics linearly within each cluster and combine the between-cluster terms in a quadratic form. CLC is not only robust to different signs of the means of individual statistics, but also reduce the degrees of freedom of the test statistic. We also theoretically prove that if we can cluster the individual statistics correctly, CLC is the most powerful test among all tests with certain quadratic forms. Our simulation results show that CLC is either the most powerful test or has similar power to the most powerful test among the tests we compared, and CLC is much more powerful than other tests when effect sizes align with inferred clusters. We also evaluate the performance of CLC through a real case study.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>R code for implementing our method is available at http://www.math.mtu.edu/~shuzhang/software.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Novel surgical strategies, including instrumentation without fusion and percutaneous instrumentation alone, have been considered less invasive and more efficient treatments.<h4>Objective</h4>To review the current literature and determine the role of fusion in instrumented fixation, as well as the role of percutaneous instrumentation, in the treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures.<h4>Methods</h4>The task force members identified search terms/parameters and a medical librarian implemented the literature search, consistent with the literature search protocol (see Appendix I), using the National Library of Medicine PubMed database and the Cochrane Library for the period from January 1, 1946 to March 31, 2015.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 906 articles were identified and 38 were selected for full-text review. Of these articles, 12 articles met criteria for inclusion in this systematic review.<h4>Conclusion</h4>There is grade A evidence for the omission of fusion in instrumented fixation for thoracolumbar burst fractures. There is grade B evidence that percutaneous instrumentation is as effective as open instrumentation for thoracolumbar burst fractures.<h4>Question</h4>Does the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented fixation improve outcomes in patients with thoracic and lumbar burst fractures?<h4>Recommendation</h4>It is recommended that in the surgical treatment of patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, surgeons should understand that the addition of arthrodesis to instrumented stabilization has not been shown to impact clinical or radiological outcomes, and adds to increased blood loss and operative time. Strength of Recommendation: Grade A.<h4>Question</h4>How does the use of minimally invasive techniques (including percutaneous instrumentation) affect outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for thoracic and lumbar fractures compared to conventional open techniques?<h4>Recommendation</h4>Stabilization using both open and percutaneous pedicle screws may be considered in the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures as the evidence suggests equivalent clinical outcomes.

30302823,Overlapping clustering of gene expression data using penalized weighted normalized cut.,"Clustering has been widely conducted in the analysis of gene expression data. For complex diseases, it has played an important role in identifying unknown functions of genes, serving as the basis of other analysis, and others. A common limitation of most existing clustering approaches is to assume that genes are separated into disjoint clusters. As genes often have multiple functions and thus can belong to more than one functional cluster, the disjoint clustering results can be unsatisfactory. In addition, due to the small sample sizes of genetic profiling studies and other factors, there may not be sufficient evidence to confirm the specific functions of some genes and cluster them definitively into disjoint clusters. In this study, we develop an effective overlapping clustering approach, which takes account into the multiplicity of gene functions and lack of certainty in practical analysis. A penalized weighted normalized cut (PWNCut) criterion is proposed based on the NCut technique and an <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub> </mml:math> norm constraint. It outperforms multiple competitors in simulation. The analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data on breast cancer and cervical cancer leads to biologically sensible findings which differ from those using the alternatives. To facilitate implementation, we develop the function pwncut in the R package NCutYX.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30367593,On the impact of uncertain gene tree rooting on duplication-transfer-loss reconciliation.,"<h4>Background</h4>Duplication-Transfer-Loss (DTL) reconciliation is a powerful and increasingly popular technique for studying the evolution of microbial gene families. DTL reconciliation requires the use of rooted gene trees to perform the reconciliation with the species tree, and the standard technique for rooting gene trees is to assign a root that results in the minimum reconciliation cost across all rootings of that gene tree. However, even though it is well understood that many gene trees have multiple optimal roots, only a single optimal root is randomly chosen to create the rooted gene tree and perform the reconciliation. This remains an important overlooked and unaddressed problem in DTL reconciliation, leading to incorrect evolutionary inferences. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of the impact of uncertain gene tree rooting on the computed DTL reconciliation and provide the first computational tools to quantify and negate the impact of gene tree rooting uncertainty on DTL reconciliation.<h4>Results</h4>Our analysis of a large data set of over 4500 gene families from 100 species shows that a large fraction of gene trees have multiple optimal rootings, that these multiple roots often, but not always, appear closely clustered together in the same region of the gene tree, that many aspects of the reconciliation remain conserved across the multiple rootings, that gene tree error has a profound impact on the prevalence and structure of multiple optimal rootings, and that there are specific interesting patterns in the reconciliation of those gene trees that have multiple optimal roots.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results show that unrooted gene trees can be meaningfully reconciled and high-quality evolutionary information can be obtained from them even after accounting for multiple optimal rootings. In addition, the techniques and tools introduced in this paper make it possible to systematically avoid incorrect evolutionary inferences caused by incorrect or uncertain gene tree rooting.

30411228,Steady Flow in a Patient-Averaged Inferior Vena Cava-Part I: Particle Image Velocimetry Measurements at Rest and Exercise Conditions.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Although many previous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies have investigated the hemodynamics in the inferior vena cava (IVC), few studies have compared computational predictions to experimental data, and only qualitative comparisons have been made. Herein, we provide particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of flow in a patient-averaged IVC geometry under idealized conditions typical of those used in the preclinical evaluation of IVC filters.<h4>Methods</h4>Measurements are acquired under rest and exercise flow rate conditions in an optically transparent model fabricated using 3D printing. To ensure that boundary conditions are well-defined and to make follow-on CFD validation studies more convenient, fully-developed flow is provided at the inlets (i.e., the iliac veins) by extending them with straight rigid tubing longer than the estimated entrance lengths. Velocity measurements are then obtained at the downstream end of the tubing to confirm Poiseuille inflow boundary conditions.<h4>Results</h4>Measurements in the infrarenal IVC reveal that flow profiles are blunter in the sagittal plane (minor axis) than in the coronal plane (major axis). Peak in-plane velocity magnitudes are 4.9�cm/s and 27�cm/s under the rest and exercise conditions, respectively. Flow profiles are less parabolic and exhibit more inflection points at the higher flow rate. Bimodal velocity peaks are also observed in the sagittal plane at the elevated flow condition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The IVC geometry, boundary conditions, and infrarenal velocity measurements are provided for download on a free and publicly accessible repository�at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7198703 . These data will facilitate future CFD validation studies of idealized, in vitro IVC hemodynamics and of similar laminar flows in vascular geometries.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30422398,Structural basis for protein phosphatase 1 recruitment by glycogen-targeting subunits.,"The rate-limiting enzymes in glycogen metabolism are subject to regulation by reversible phosphorylation. The glycogen-targeted protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) holoenzyme catalyzes their dephosphorylation. It is composed of a catalytic subunit (PP1C) and a glycogen-targeting subunit (G subunit). To date, seven G subunits have been identified. They all contain an RVxF PP1C-binding motif. The interactions between this motif in the skeletal muscle-specific G<sub>M</sub> and PP1C have been revealed by structural studies. However, whether elements outside of this motif contribute to the interaction with PP1C is not clear. In this study, we found that residues next to the RVxF motif in G<sub>M</sub> also mediate interactions to PP1C and revealed the mechanism of the interaction by structural studies. Sequence analysis revealed that the PP1C-binding region in G<sub>M</sub> is highly conserved among G subunits. Consistently, we found that the equivalent region in the liver-enriched G<sub>L</sub> adopts a similar structure upon binding PP1C. Dephosphorylation experiments indicated that this region and the glycogen-binding region in G<sub>M</sub> cooperate to stimulate PP1C's activity toward glycogen-associated substrates. DATABASES: The structure factors and coordinates for the PP1Ca-G<sub>M</sub> (1-99) and PP1Ca-G<sub>L</sub> (31-105) complexes have been deposited into the Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org), with the accession codes 5ZQV and 5ZT0, respectively.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30423080,DREAM-Yara: an exact read mapper for very large databases with short update time.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Mapping-based approaches have become limited in their application to very large sets of references since computing an FM-index for very large databases (e.g. >10 GB) has become a bottleneck. This affects many analyses that need such index as an essential step for approximate matching of the NGS reads to reference databases. For instance, in typical metagenomics analysis, the size of the reference sequences has become prohibitive to compute a single full-text index on standard machines. Even on large memory machines, computing such index takes about 1 day of computing time. As a result, updates of indices are rarely performed. Hence, it is desirable to create an alternative way of indexing while preserving fast search times.<h4>Results</h4>To solve the index construction and update problem we propose the DREAM (Dynamic seaRchablE pArallel coMpressed index) framework and provide an implementation. The main contributions are the introduction of an approximate search distributor via a novel use of Bloom filters. We combine several Bloom filters to form an interleaved Bloom filter and use this new data structure to quickly exclude reads for parts of the databases where they cannot match. This allows us to keep the databases in several indices which can be easily rebuilt if parts are updated while maintaining a fast search time. The second main contribution is an implementation of DREAM-Yara a distributed version of a fully sensitive read mapper under the DREAM framework.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://gitlab.com/pirovc/dream_yara/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30467523,gganatogram: An R package for modular visualisation of anatograms and tissues based on ggplot2.,"Displaying data onto anatomical structures is a convenient technique to quickly observe tissue related information. However, drawing tissues is a complex task that requires both expertise in anatomy and the arts. While web based applications exist for displaying gene expression on anatograms, other non-genetic disciplines lack similar tools. Moreover, web based tools often lack the modularity associated with packages in programming languages, such as R. Here I present gganatogram, an R package used to plot modular species anatograms based on a combination of the graphical grammar of ggplot2 and the publicly available anatograms from the Expression Atlas. This combination allows for quick and easy, modular, and reproducible generation of anatograms. Using only one command and a data frame with tissue name, group, colour, and �value, this tool enables the user to visualise specific human and mouse tissues with desired colours, grouped by a variable, or displaying a desired value, such as gene-expression, pharmacokinetics, or bacterial load across selected tissues. gganatogram consists of 5 highly annotated organisms, male/female human/mouse, and a cell anatogram. It further consists of 24 other less annotated organisms from the animal and plant kingdom. I hope that this tool will be useful by the wider community in biological sciences. Community members are welcome to submit additional anatograms, which can be incorporated into the package. A stable version gganatogram has been deposited to neuroconductor, and a development version can be found on� github/jespermaag/gganatogram. An interactive shiny app of gganatogram can be found on� https://jespermaag.shinyapps.io/gganatogram/, which allows for non-R users to create anatograms.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

30567473,Cloud-BS: A MapReduce-based bisulfite sequencing aligner on cloud.,"In recent years, there have been many studies utilizing DNA methylome data to answer fundamental biological questions. Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) has enabled measurement of a genome-wide absolute level of DNA methylation at single-nucleotide resolution. However, due to the ambiguity introduced by bisulfite-treatment, the aligning process especially in large-scale epigenetic research is still considered a huge burden. We present Cloud-BS, an efficient BS-seq aligner designed for parallel execution on a distributed environment. Utilizing Apache Hadoop framework, Cloud-BS splits sequencing reads into multiple blocks and transfers them to distributed nodes. By designing each aligning procedure into separate map and reducing tasks while an internal key-value structure is optimized based on the MapReduce programming model, the algorithm significantly improves alignment performance without sacrificing mapping accuracy. In addition, Cloud-BS minimizes the innate burden of configuring a distributed environment by providing a pre-configured cloud image. Cloud-BS shows significantly improved bisulfite alignment performance compared to other existing BS-seq aligners. We believe our algorithm facilitates large-scale methylome data analysis.

30578582,Sex differences in the circulatory responses to an isocapnic cold pressor test.,"<h4>New findings</h4>What is the central question of this study? Do sex differences exist in the cardiorespiratory responses to an isocapnic cold pressor test (CPT)? What is the main finding and its importance? During the CPT, there were no sex differences in the respiratory response; however, females demonstrated a reduced mean arterial pressure and reduced dilatation of the common carotid artery. Given that the CPT is predictive of future cardiovascular events, these data have clinical implications for improving the utility of the CPT to determine cardiovascular health risk. Sex differences should be taken into consideration when conducting and interpreting a CPT.<h4>Abstract</h4>The cold pressor test (CPT) elicits a transient increase in sympathetic nervous activity, minute ventilation ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> ), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and common carotid artery (CCA) diameter in healthy individuals. Although the extent of dilatation of the CCA in response to the CPT has been used as a clinical indicator of cardiovascular health status, the potential sex differences have yet to be explored. In response to a CPT, we hypothesized that elevations in <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> and MAP and dilatation of the CCA would be attenuated in females compared with males. In 20 young, healthy participants (10 females), we measured the respiratory, cardiovascular and CCA responses during a CPT, which consisted of a 3�min immersion of the right foot into 0-1 ice water. Blood pressure (via finger photoplethysmography), heart rate (via electrocardiogram) and CCA diameter and velocity (via Duplex ultrasound) were simultaneously recorded immediately before and during the CPT. During the CPT, while controlling end-tidal gases to baseline values, the main findings were as follows: (i) no sex differences were present in absolute or relative changes in <mml:math xmlns:mml=""""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""""> <mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>V</mml:mi> <mml:mo><U+0307></mml:mo></mml:mover> <mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:msub> </mml:math> (P�=�0.801 and P�=�0.179, respectively); (ii) the relative MAP and CCA diameter response were reduced in females by 51 and 55%, respectively (P�=�0.008 and P�=�0.029�versus males, respectively); and (iii) the relative MAP responses was positively correlated with the dilatation of the CCA in males (r�=�0.42, P�=�0.019), in females (r�=�0.43, P�=�0.019) and in males and females combined (r�=�0.55, P�<�0.001). Given that the CPT is used as a clinical tool to assess cardiovascular health status, sex differences should be considered in future studies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30591010,DLAD4U: deriving and prioritizing disease lists from PubMed literature.,"<h4>Background</h4>Due to recent technology advancements, disease related knowledge is growing rapidly. It becomes nontrivial to go through all published literature to identify associations between human diseases and genetic, environmental, and life style factors, disease symptoms, and treatment strategies. Here we report DLAD4U (Disease List Automatically Derived For You), an efficient, accurate and easy-to-use disease search engine based on PubMed literature.<h4>Results</h4>DLAD4U uses the eSearch and eFetch APIs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) to find publications related to a query and to identify diseases from the retrieved publications. The hypergeometric test was used to prioritize identified diseases for displaying to users. DLAD4U accepts any valid queries for PubMed, and the output results include a ranked disease list, information associated with each disease, chronologically-ordered supporting publications, a summary of the run, and links for file export. DLAD4U outperformed other disease search engines in our comparative evaluation using selected genes and drugs as query terms and manually curated data as """"gold standard"""". For 100 genes that are associated with only one disease in the gold standard, the Mean Average Precision (MAP) measure from DLAD4U was 0.77, which clearly outperformed other tools. For 10 genes that are associated with multiple diseases in the gold standard, the mean precision, recall and F-measure scores from DLAD4U were always higher than those from other tools. The superior performance of DLAD4U was further confirmed using 100 drugs as queries, with an MAP of 0.90.<h4>Conclusions</h4>DLAD4U is a new, intuitive disease search engine that takes advantage of existing resources at NCBI to provide computational efficiency and uses statistical analyses to ensure accuracy. DLAD4U is publicly available at http://dlad4u.zhang-lab.org .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30611208,Development and validation of a risk score to predict mortality during TB treatment in patients with TB-diabetes comorbidity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Making an accurate prognosis for mortality during tuberculosis (TB) treatment in TB-diabetes (TB-DM) comorbid patients remains a challenge for health professionals, especially in low TB prevalent populations, due to the lack of a standardized prognostic model.<h4>Methods</h4>Using de-identified data from TB-DM patients from Texas, who received TB treatment had a treatment outcome of completed treatment or died before completion, reported to the National TB Surveillance System from January 2010-December 2016, we developed and internally validated a mortality scoring system, based on the regression coefficients.<h4>Results</h4>Of 1227 included TB-DM patients, 112 (9.1%) died during treatment. The score used nine characteristics routinely collected by most TB programs. Patients were divided into three groups based on their score: low-risk (< 12 points), medium-risk (12-21 points) and high-risk (=22 points). The model had good performance (with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.83 in development and 0.82 in validation), and good calibration. A practical mobile calculator app was also created ( https://oaa.app.link/Isqia5rN6K ).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using demographic and clinical characteristics which are available from most TB programs at the patient's initial visits, our simple scoring system had good performance and may be a practical clinical tool for TB health professionals in identifying TB-DM comorbid patients with a high mortality risk.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30687361,PolyMorphPredict: A Universal Web-Tool for Rapid Polymorphic Microsatellite Marker Discovery From Whole Genome and Transcriptome Data.,"Microsatellites are ubiquitously distributed, polymorphic repeat sequence valuable for association, selection, population structure and identification. They can be mined by genomic library, probe hybridization and sequencing of selected clones. Such approach has many limitations like biased hybridization and selection of larger repeats. In silico mining of polymorphic markers using data of various genotypes can be rapid and economical. Available tools lack in some or other aspects like: targeted user defined primer generation, polymorphism discovery using multiple sequence, size and number limits of input sequence, no option for primer generation and e-PCR evaluation, transferability, lack of complete automation and user-friendliness. They also lack the provision to evaluate published primers in e-PCR mode to generate additional allelic data using re-sequenced data of various genotypes for judicious utilization of previously generated data. We developed the tool (PolyMorphPredict) using Perl, R, Java and launched at Apache which is available at http://webtom.cabgrid.res.in/polypred/. It mines microsatellite loci and computes primers from genome/transcriptome data of any species. It can perform e-PCR using published primers for polymorphism discovery and across species transferability of microsatellite loci. Present tool has been evaluated using five species of different genome size having 21 genotypes. Though server is equipped with genomic data of three species for test run with gel simulation, but can be used for any species. Further, polymorphism predictability has been validated using in silico and in vitro PCR of four rice genotypes. This tool can accelerate the in silico microsatellite polymorphism discovery in re-sequencing projects of any species of plant and animal for their diversity estimation along with variety/breed identification, population structure, MAS, QTL and gene discovery, traceability, parentage testing, fungal diagnostics and genome finishing.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30701134,"Prognostic values of GMPS, PR, CD40, and p21 in ovarian cancer.","Early detection and prediction of prognosis and treatment responses are all the keys in improving survival of ovarian cancer patients. This study profiled an ovarian cancer progression model to identify prognostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer patients. Mouse ovarian surface epithelial cells (MOSECs) can undergo spontaneous malignant transformation in vitro cell culture. These were used as a model of ovarian cancer progression for alterations in gene expression and signaling detected using the Illumina HiSeq2000 Next-Generation Sequencing platform and bioinformatical analyses. The differential expression of four selected genes was identified using the gene expression profiling interaction analysis (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/) and then associated with survival in ovarian cancer patients using the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset and the online Kaplan-Meier Plotter (http://www.kmplot.com) data. The data showed 263 aberrantly expressed genes, including 182 up-regulated and 81 down-regulated genes between the early and late stages of tumor progression in MOSECs. The bioinformatic data revealed four genes (i.e., guanosine 5'-monophosphate synthase (GMPS), progesterone receptor (PR), CD40, and p21 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A)) to play an important role in ovarian cancer progression. Furthermore, the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset validated the differential expression of these four genes, which were associated with prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. In conclusion, this study profiled differentially expressed genes using the ovarian cancer progression model and identified four (i.e., GMPS, PR, CD40, and p21) as prognostic markers for ovarian cancer patients. Future studies of prospective patients could further verify the clinical usefulness of this four-gene signature.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30708525,First Report of Impatiens Downy Mildew Outbreaks Caused by Plasmopara obducens Throughout the Hawai'ian Islands.,"Downy mildew of impatiens (Impatiens walleriana Hook.f.) was first reported from the continental United States in 2004. In 2011 to 2012, severe and widespread outbreaks were documented across the United States mainland, resulting in considerable economic losses. On May 5, 2013, downy mildew disease symptoms were observed from I. walleriana 'Super Elfin' at a retail nursery in Mililani, on the Hawai'ian island of Oahu. Throughout May and June 2013, additional sightings of the disease were documented from the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Maui, and Hawai'i from nurseries, home gardens, and botanical park and landscape plantings. Symptoms of infected plants initially showed downward leaf curl, followed by a stippled chlorotic appearance on the adaxial leaf surfaces. Abaxial leaf surfaces were covered with a layer of white mycelia. Affected plants exhibited defoliation, flower drop, and stem rot as the disease progressed. Based on morphological and molecular data, the organism was identified as Plasmopara obducens (J. Schr�t.) J. Schr�t. Microscopic observation disclosed coenocytic mycelium and hyaline, thin-walled, tree-like (monopodial branches), straight, 94.0 to 300.0 � 3.2 to 10.8 �m sporangiophores. Ovoid, hyaline sporangia measuring 11.0 to 14.6 � 12.2 to 16.2 (average 13.2 � 14.7) �m were borne on sterigma tips of rigid branchlets (8.0 to 15.0 �m) at right angle to the main axis of the sporangiophores (1,3). Molecular identification of the pathogen was conducted by removing hyphae from the surface of three heavily infected leaves using sterile tweezers, then extracting DNA using the QIAGEN Plant DNA kit (QIAGEN, Gaithersburg, MD). The nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer was sequenced from each of the three samples bidirectionally from Illustra EXOStar (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) purified amplicon generated from primers ITS1-O and LR-0R (4). Resultant sequences (GenBank KF366378 to 80) shared 99 to 100% nucleotide identity with P. obducens accession DQ665666 (4). A voucher specimen (BPI892676) was deposited in the U.S. National Fungus Collections, Beltsville, MD. Pathogenicity tests were performed by spraying 6-week-old impatiens plants (I. walleriana var. Super Elfin) grown singly in 4-inch pots with a suspension of 1 � 10<sup>4</sup> P. obducens sporangia/ml until runoff using a handheld atomizer. Control plants were sprayed with distilled water. The plants were kept in high humidity by covering with black plastic bags for 48 h at 20�C, and then maintained in the greenhouse (night/day temperature of 20/24�C). The first symptoms (downward curling and chlorotic stippling of leaves) and sporulation of the pathogen on under-leaf surfaces of the inoculated plants appeared at 10 days and 21 days after inoculation, respectively. Control plants remained healthy. Morphological features and measurements matched those of the original inoculum, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of downy mildew on I. walleriana in Hawai'i (2). The disease appears to be widespread throughout the islands and is likely to cause considerable losses in Hawai'ian landscapes and production settings. References: (1) O. Constantinescu.

30714121,The histidine decarboxylase model of tic pathophysiology: a new focus on the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor.,"Histamine dysregulation was implicated as a rare cause of Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders a decade ago by a landmark genetic study in a high density family pedigree, which implicated a hypomorphic mutation in the histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) gene as a rare but high penetrance genetic cause. Studies in Hdc knockout (KO) mice have confirmed that this mutation causes tic-relevant behavioural and neurochemical abnormalities that parallel what is seen in patients and thus validate the KO as a potentially informative model of tic pathophysiology. Recent studies have focused on the potential role of the histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor in this model, and by association in tic disorders and related neuropsychiatric conditions. The H<sub>3</sub> receptor is up-regulated in the striatum in Hdc KO mice. As the H<sub>3</sub> receptor has constitutive activity in the absence of ligand, this receptor up-regulation may have significant cellular effects despite the absence of neurotransmitter histamine in these mice. Activation in vivo of H<sub>3</sub> receptors in wild type mice regulates signalling in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that interacts non-linearly with dopamine receptor signalling. Baseline signalling alterations in MSNs in Hdc KO mice resemble those seen after H<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist treatment in wild type animals. H<sub>3</sub> receptor agonist treatment in the KOs further accentuates most of these signalling abnormalities and produces behavioural stereotypy. Together, these data suggest the intriguing hypothesis that constitutive signalling by up-regulated H<sub>3</sub> receptors explains many of the molecular and behavioural abnormalities seen in these animals.

30722515,"First Report of Globisporangium ultimum Causing Pythium Damping-Off on Aleppo Pine in Algeria, Africa, and the Mediterranean Region.","Globisporangium ultimum (Trow) Uzuhashi, Tojo & Kakish. (syn. Pythium ultimum Trow, syn. P. ultimum Trow var. ultimum) is a known oomycetal species from Pythium s.l. causing damping-off and/or root rot on a great variety of plants throughout the world, including some pine species (Pinus L.) and conifers (2,3). Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) is a common native forest tree in the Mediterranean region. Pre- and post-emergence damping-off disease symptoms were observed during 2008 and 2009 in four forest nurseries from northwestern Algeria (Relizane, Sidi Belabes, and Tlemcen departments). This disease occurred under cool conditions, and Aleppo pines were significantly affected, reducing seedling emergence. Disinfected segments, about 5 mm in length, from decayed root and collar, were cultured on CMA at 25�C. This oomycetal species was identified based on the species description in Pythium keys (3,4). For the molecular identification, PCR was used to amplify the ITS region of Pythium isolates. It was amplified with the flanking primers ITS1 and ITS4, and these products were directly sequenced. Sequence data were compared to known sequences deposited in the NCBI non redundant database to confirm morphological identification. A BLAST search identified U3CR, U7CR, U1RT, U2CR, U4CR, U14CR, U7RT, and U17RT isolates (GenBank Accession Nos. JX191921, 22, 27, 29, 31, and 33 to 35, respectively) as G. ultimum based on 100% similarity with corresponding sequence of the reference isolate no. UZ056 MAFF240024 (AB468781) (3). Phytopathogenicity testing was conducted in a petri dish and pot experiment. In the petri dish experiment, a 3 mm diameter plug was transferred from a 7-day-old CMA colony to the center of a CMA petri dish, with three replicates per isolate, and three control plates were inoculated with sterile agar plugs. After 72 h, 10 Aleppo pine seeds were placed equally spaced to 1 cm from the edge of each plug. After 7 days at 22�C in the dark, germination inhibition (46.1 to 87.6%) and root growth inhibition (62.3 to 92.2%) were calculated. In the control plates, germination failure (13.4%) and root length (27.7 cm) were observed. For the pot experiment, inocula were produced by adding a 5 mm diameter plug from a 7-day-old CMA culture to a previously sterilized 500 ml flask containing 237.5 g sand, 12.5 g cornmeal, and 80 ml SDW. Nine-day-old inoculum was mixed with sterile soil at a rate of 1:3 (v:v). Inoculum was transferred to 500 ml pot, and 10 Aleppo pine seeds were planted, with three replicates per isolate, and three control pots were used. After 2 weeks, all of the isolates tested caused typical symptoms of Aleppo pine Pythium damping-off, the percentage of inoculated plants that became infected was 36.6 to 83.3%. In the control pots, no infected plants were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report of G. ultimum causing damping-off on Aleppo pine in Algeria, Africa, and the Mediterranean Region.

30722630,First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Erysiphe platani on Sycamore (Platanus occidentalis) in South Korea.,"Platanus occidentalis L. (sycamore) is an important shade tree distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere and in South Korea. It has been widely used as an ornamental tree, especially in urban regions and by roadsides. The average rate of roadside planting throughout South Korea covers about 5.7% (up to 38% in Seoul), equivalent to 0.36 million trees. In early July 2012, after a rainy spell in summer, an outbreak of powdery mildew on sycamore was first observed on roadside trees in Gwangju, a southern province of South Korea. A more extensive nationwide survey revealed no powdery mildew in northern or central regions of South Korea. The disease has spread rapidly within Gwangju, even though fungicide applications were carried out after the rainy spell. Major symptoms included white, superficial mycelia, grey to brown lesions on the surface of the leaves due to the presence of a hyperparasite (tentatively identified as Ampelomyces sp.), a slight chlorosis, and severe leaf distortion followed by defoliation. Conidiophores were produced singly, straight, and unbranched, with lengths of 35.2 to 315.2 �m (average 170.4 �m). Conidia were ellipsoid or doliiform, ranging in size from 34.9 to 47.4 �m (average 38.2 �m) long � 16.5 to 26.8 �m (average 23.9 �m) wide. Primary conidia had a truncate base and rounded apex; secondary conidia had both a truncate base and apex. The conidial outer surface had a reticulated wrinkling. Cleistothecia (i.e., sexual spore structures) were not found during the survey, which extended from July to October. These characteristics and the host species match those of Microsphaera platani (syn. Erysiphe platani), which was described on P. occidentalis in Washington State (2). Fungal rDNA was amplified using primers ITS1 and LR5F (4) for one sample (EML-PLA1, GenBank JX485651). BLASTn searches of GenBank revealed high sequence identity to E. platani (99.5% to JQ365943 and 99.3% to JQ365940). Recently, Liang et al. (3) reported the first occurrence of powdery mildew by E. platani on P. orientalis in China based only on its morphology. Thus, in this study, author could only use ITS sequence data from the United States and Europe to characterize the isolate. To date, nine records of powdery mildews of Platanus spp. have been reported worldwide: on P. hispanica from Brazil, Japan, Hungary, and Slovakia; P. orientalis from Israel; P. racemosa from the United States; P. � acerifolia from the United Kingdom and Germany; and Platanus sp. from Argentina and Australia (1). Interestingly, the hyperparasite, Ampelomyces sp., was found with E. platani, suggesting that there may be some level of biocontrol in nature. Pathogenicity was confirmed by gently pressing diseased leaves onto six leaves of healthy sycamore plants in the field in September. The treated leaves were sealed in sterilized vinyl pack to maintain humid condition for 2 days. Similar symptoms were observed on the inoculated leaves 10 days after inoculation. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by re-observing the fungal pathogen. To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by E. platani on sycamore in South Korea. References: (1) D.

30783000,Doravirine and the Potential for CYP3A-Mediated Drug-Drug Interactions.,"Identifying and understanding potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are vital for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. This article discusses DDIs between doravirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), and cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) substrates and drugs that modulate CYP3A activity. Consistent with previously published <i>in vitro</i> data and DDI trials with the CYP3A substrates midazolam and atorvastatin, doravirine did not have any meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of the CYP3A substrates ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel. Coadministration of doravirine with CYP3A inhibitors (ritonavir or ketoconazole) increased doravirine exposure approximately 3-fold. However, these increases were not considered clinically meaningful. Conversely, previously published trials showed that coadministered CYP3A inducers (rifampin and rifabutin) decreased doravirine exposure by 88% and 50%, respectively (K. L. Yee, S. G. Khalilieh, R. I. Sanchez, R. Liu, et al., Clin Drug Investig 37:659-667, 2017 [https://doi.org/10.1007/s40261-017-0513-4]; S. G. Khalilieh, K. L. Yee, R. I. Sanchez, R. Liu, et al., J Clin Pharmacol 58:1044-1052, 2018 [https://doi.org/10.1002/jcph.1103]), while doravirine exposure following prior efavirenz administration led to an initial reduction in doravirine exposure of 62%, but the reduction became less pronounced with time (K. L. Yee, R. I. Sanchez, P. Auger, R. Liu, et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother 61:e01757-16, 2017 [https://doi.org/10.1128/AAC.01757-16]). Overall, the coadministration of doravirine with CYP3A inhibitors and substrates is, therefore, supported by these data together with efficacy and safety data from clinical trials, while coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, cannot be recommended. Concomitant dosing with rifabutin (a CYP3A inducer less potent than rifampin) is acceptable if doravirine dosing is adjusted from once to twice daily; however, the effect of other moderate inducers on doravirine pharmacokinetics is unknown.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30832735,Ultrasound Elastography supplement assessing nodal status of magnetic resonance imaging staged cervical N0 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"<h4>Background</h4>To determine whether ultrasound elastography can distinguish reactive or metastatic small lymph nodes (sLN) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staged cervical N0 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).<h4>Methods</h4>A pilot study was performed involving the diagnostic performances of conventional high-frequency ultrasound (CHFU) and/or shear wave elastography (SWE) for predicting metastases in sLN of MRI-staged N0 NPC patients with reference to the histologically-proven ultrasound guided core needle biopsy (US-CNB). The diagnosis of CHFU was based on the superficial lymph node ultrasonic criteria with the five-point-scale (FPS). The mean (Emean), minimum (Emin) and maximum (Emax) of the elasticity indices were measured by SWE at the stiffest part of the sLN in kilopascal. Diagnostic performances were analyzed using a receiver operating curve (ROC) on a per-node basis. The authenticity of this article has been validated by uploading the key raw data onto the Research Data Deposit public platform ( http://www.researchdata.org.cn ), with the approval RDD number as RDDA2017000447.<h4>Results</h4>All 113 cervical sLN of 49 MRI-staged cervical N0 NPC patients underwent evaluation of CHFU and SWE; 38 sLN (FPS < 2) were regarded as benign, which were excluded from subsequent analysis due to none biopsy-proven. And 75 indeterminate sLN (FPS�=�2) were referred to US-CNB and revealed 15 (20%) metastases. All SWE elastic indices were significantly higher in malignant sLNs than in benign sLNs (p�< 0.05). Moreover, Emax exhibited the highest diagnostic value (AUC:0.733 � 0.067, p�= 0.005) with excellent measurement reproducibility (ICC: 0.786; 95%CI: 0.684, 0.864). CHFU plus SWE was superior to CHFU or SWE alone for predicting metastases in sLN of MRI-staged N0 patients with NPC (p�< 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>CHFU plus SWE is an optional non-invasive modality to supplement MRI in assessing cervical nodal status of patients with NPC.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced

30918038,Relationship between sociodemographic factors and specialty destination of UK trainee doctors: a national cohort study.,"OBJECTIVES:Many countries are driving forward policies to widen the socioeconomic profile of medical students and to train more medical students for certain specialties. However, little is known about how socioeconomic origin relates to specialty choice. Nor is there a good understanding of the relationship between academic performance and specialty choice. To address these gaps, our aim was to identify the relationship between socioeconomic background, academic performance and accepted offers into specialty training. DESIGN:Longitudinal, cohort study using data from the UK Medical Education Database (https://www.ukmed.ac.uk/). PARTICIPANTS:6065 (60% females) UK doctors who accepted offers to a specialty training (residency) post after completing the 2-year generic foundation programme (UK Foundation Programme) between 2012 and 2014. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:<U+03A7>2 tests were used to examine the relationships between sociodemographic characteristics, academic ability and the dependent variable, specialty choice. Multiple data imputation was used to address the issue of missing data. Multinomial regression was employed to test the independent variables in predicting the likelihood of choosing a given specialty. RESULTS:Participants pursuing careers in more competitive specialties had significantly higher academic scores than colleagues pursuing less competitive ones. After controlling for the presence of multiple factors, trainees who came from families where no parent was educated to a degree level had statistically significant lower odds of choosing careers in medical specialties relative to general practice (OR=0.78, 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.92). Students who entered medical school as school leavers, compared with mature students, had odds 1.2 times higher (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.56) of choosing surgical specialties than general practice. CONCLUSIONS:The data indicate a direct association between trainees' sociodemographic characteristics, academic ability and career choices. The findings can be used by medical school, training boards and workforce planners to inform recruitment and retention strategies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30967119,Large-scale 3D chromatin reconstruction from chromosomal contacts.,"<h4>Background</h4>Recent advances in genome analysis have established that chromatin has preferred 3D conformations, which bring distant loci into contact. Identifying these contacts is important for us to understand possible interactions between these loci. This has motivated the creation of the Hi-C technology, which detects long-range chromosomal interactions. Distance geometry-based algorithms, such as ChromSDE and ShRec3D, have been able to utilize Hi-C data to infer 3D chromosomal structures. However, these algorithms, being matrix-based, are space- and time-consuming on very large datasets. A human genome of 100 kilobase resolution would involve ~30,000 loci, requiring gigabytes just in storing the matrices.<h4>Results</h4>We propose a succinct representation of the distance matrices which tremendously reduces the space requirement. We give a complete solution, called SuperRec, for the inference of chromosomal structures from Hi-C data, through iterative solving the large-scale weighted multidimensional scaling problem.<h4>Conclusions</h4>SuperRec runs faster than earlier systems without compromising on result accuracy. The SuperRec package can be obtained from http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~shuaicli/SuperRec .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30979697,Visualizing Patterns in Pediatric and Adult Hospital Care.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>We aimed to design a graphical tool for understanding and effectively communicating the complex differences between pediatric and adult hospital care systems.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We analyzed the most recent hospital administrative data sets for inpatient admission and emergency department visits from 7 US states (2014: Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New York; 2011: California). Probabilities of care completion (Pcc) were calculated for pediatric (<18 years old) and adult conditions in all acute-care hospitals in each state. Using the Pcc, we constructed interactive heatmap visualizations for direct comparison of pediatric and adult hospital care systems.<h4>Results</h4>On average, across the 7 states, 70.6% of all hospitals had Pcc >0.5 for more than half of all adult conditions, whereas <14.9% of hospitals had Pcc >0.1 for half of pediatric conditions. Visualizations revealed wide variation among states with clearly apparent institutional dependencies and condition-specific gaps (full interactive versions are available at https://goo.gl/5t8vAw).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The functional disparities between pediatric and adult hospital care systems are substantial, and condition-specific differences should be considered in reimbursement strategies, disaster planning, network adequacy determinations, and public health planning.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Long-term real-world data are currently scarce for CD patients previously exposed to several biologics.<h4>Methods</h4>This is an observational, national, retrospective multicentre study. Patients received intravenous UST ~6 mg/kg at baseline, with 90 mg subcutaneously thereafter every 8 weeks. Response and remission rates were assessed at Weeks 8, 16, and 52.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 152 patients were analysed. All patients were exposed to at least one anti-TNFa agent, with 69.7% were exposed to even two anti-TNFa and vedolizumab. After 1 year, 42.1% and 25.7% of patients had experienced clinical response and clinical remission, respectively, and 38.8% and 24.3% had achieved steroid-free clinical response and remission, respectively; 38.8% of patients discontinued therapy during the 12 months of follow-up. Colonic location was predictive of clinical response at 1 year, and low body mass index [BMI] at baseline was a negative predictor of clinical remission. Resolution of arthralgia was associated with clinical response over time. De novo arthralgia was reported by 17.9% of patients at Week 8 and 13.5% of patients at Week 52. No impact of UST on arthralgia was observed in patients with concomitant ankylosing spondylitis [n = 17]. Others adverse events were reported in 7.2% of patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This real-world cohort study confirms the effectiveness of UST in CD patients previously exposed to several biologics. Ustekinumab was well tolerated with respect to adverse events.<h4>Podcast</h4>This article has an associated podcast which can be accessed at https://academic.oup.com/ecco-jcc/pages/podcast.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31001324,BayesPI-BAR2: A New Python Package for Predicting Functional Non-coding Mutations in Cancer Patient Cohorts.,"Most of somatic mutations in cancer occur outside of gene coding regions. These mutations may disrupt the gene regulation by affecting protein-DNA interaction. A study of these disruptions is important in understanding tumorigenesis. However, current computational tools process DNA sequence variants individually, when predicting the effect on protein-DNA binding. Thus, it is a daunting task to identify functional regulatory disturbances among thousands of mutations in a patient. Previously, we have reported and validated a pipeline for identifying functional non-coding somatic mutations in cancer patient cohorts, by integrating diverse information such as gene expression, spatial distribution of the mutations, and a biophysical model for estimating protein binding affinity. Here, we present a new user-friendly Python package BayesPI-BAR2 based on the proposed pipeline for integrative whole-genome sequence analysis. This may be the first prediction package that considers information from both multiple mutations and multiple patients. It is evaluated in follicular lymphoma and skin cancer patients, by focusing on sequence variants in gene promoter regions. BayesPI-BAR2 is a useful tool for predicting functional non-coding mutations in whole genome sequencing data: it allows identification of novel transcription factors (TFs) whose binding is altered by non-coding mutations in cancer. BayesPI-BAR2 program can analyze multiple datasets of genome-wide mutations at once and generate concise, easily interpretable reports for potentially affected gene regulatory sites.

31031918,Future temperature and salinity do not exert selection pressure on cyst germination of a toxic phytoplankton species.,"Environmental conditions regulate the germination of phytoplankton resting stages. While some factors lead to synchronous germination, others stimulate germination of only a small fraction of the resting stages. This suggests that habitat filters may act on the germination level and thus affect selection of blooming strains. Benthic """"seed banks"""" of the toxic dinoflagellate <i>Alexandrium ostenfeldii</i> from the Baltic Sea are genetically and phenotypically diverse, indicating a high potential for adaptation by selection on standing genetic variation. Here, we experimentally tested the role of climate-related salinity and temperature as selection filters during germination and subsequent establishment of <i>A.�ostenfeldii</i> strains. A representative resting cyst population was isolated from sediment samples, and germination and reciprocal transplantation experiments were carried out, including four treatments: Average present day germination conditions and three potential future conditions: high temperature, low salinity, and high temperature in combination with low salinity. We found that the final germination success of <i>A.�ostenfeldii</i> resting cysts was unaffected by temperature and salinity in the range tested. A high germination success of more than 80% in all treatments indicates that strains are not selected by temperature and salinity during germination, but selection becomes more important shortly after germination, in the vegetative stage of the life cycle. Moreover, strains were not adapted to germination conditions. Instead, highly plastic responses occurred after transplantation and significantly higher growth rates were observed at higher temperature. High variability of strain-specific responses has probably masked the overall effect of the treatments, highlighting the importance of testing the effect of environmental factors on many strains. It is likely that <i>A.�ostenfeldii</i> populations can persist in the future, because suitable strains, which are able to germinate and grow well at potential future climate conditions, are part of the highly diverse cyst population.<h4>Open research badges</h4>This article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available the digitally-shareable data necessary to reproduce the reported results.

It is the hope that this Guideline becomes a reference for effective evidence-based surgical management of LUTS/BPH.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The evidence team searched Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality database to identify studies indexed between January 2007-September 2017. Following initial publication, this guideline was amended in 2019 and reflects relevant literature published through January 2019. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, https://www.jurology.com).<h4>Results</h4>This Guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding management of LUTS/BPH utilizing surgery and minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST). Additional statements are made regarding diagnostic and pre-operative tests. Clinical statements are made in comparison to what is generally accepted as the gold standard (i.e. transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP] monopolar and/or bipolar). This guideline is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm (see figure).[Figure: see text]Conclusions:The prevalence and the severity of LUTS increases as men age and is an important diagnosis in the healthcare of patients and the welfare of society.

Meanwhile, the low speed prevents the programs from being applied to large-scale RNA structural database search.<h4>Results</h4>We developed an open-source algorithm, RNA-align, for RNA 3D structure alignment which has the structure similarity scaled by a size-independent and statistically interpretable scoring metric. Large-scale benchmark tests show that RNA-align significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art programs in both alignment accuracy and running speed. The major advantage of RNA-align lies at the quick convergence of the heuristic alignment iterations and the coarse-grained secondary structure assignment, both of which are crucial to the speed and accuracy of RNA structure alignments.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/RNA-align/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Q. grandiflora is a plant that accumulates aluminum (Al) in high quantities and requires it for growth and development. Although quite relevant for the understanding of Al effects on plants, the proteome of Q. grandiflora has not been studied yet. Therefore, the current proteome analysis identifies a total of 2010 proteins. Furthermore, the identified Q. grandiflora root proteins are associated with several crucial molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular sites.

31199465,Positive multistate protein design.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Structure-based computational protein design (CPD) plays a critical role in advancing the field of protein engineering. Using an all-atom energy function, CPD tries to identify amino acid sequences that fold into a target structure and ultimately perform a desired function. The usual approach considers a single rigid backbone as a target, which ignores backbone flexibility. Multistate design (MSD) allows instead to consider several backbone states simultaneously, defining challenging computational problems.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce efficient reductions of positive MSD problems to Cost Function Networks with two different fitness definitions and implement them in the Pompd (Positive Multistate Protein design) software. Pompd is able to identify guaranteed optimal sequences of positive multistate full protein redesign problems and exhaustively enumerate suboptimal sequences close to the MSD optimum. Applied to nuclear magnetic resonance and back-rubbed X-ray structures, we observe that the average energy fitness provides the best sequence recovery. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art guaranteed computational design approaches by orders of magnitudes and can solve MSD problems with sizes previously unreachable with guaranteed algorithms.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://forgemia.inra.fr/thomas.schiex/pompd as documented Open Source.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

It is possible that participant's characteristics measured at baseline can identify people with chronic low back pain who would respond best to a treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model.<h4>Objectives</h4>To assess if specific characteristics of people with chronic low back pain measured at baseline can modify the effects of a treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model on pain and disability.<h4>Methods</h4>Four variables assessed at baseline that could potentially modify the treatment effects of the treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model were selected (age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification). Separate univariate models were used to investigate a possible modifier treatment effect of baseline participant's characteristics on pain and disability after the treatment. Findings of interaction values above 1 point for the outcome mean pain intensity or above 3 points for disability (Roland Morris questionnaire) were considered clinically relevant.<h4>Results</h4>Linear regression analyses for the outcomes of pain and disability did not show interaction values considered clinically relevant for age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Age, educational status, physical activity status and STarT back tool classification did not modify the effects of an 8-week treatment based on the Movement System Impairment model in patients with chronic low back pain.

31236209,The research crisis in American institutions of complementary and integrative health: one proposed solution for chiropractic profession.,"A crisis confronts the Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) teaching institutions in the US. Research infrastructure is needed to build and sustain productive research programs and retain their own research faculty. In most health professions, this infrastructure is largely built through research grants. In CIH, most educational institutions are funded through student tuition, which has historically also had to be the source for building their research programs. Only a limited number of these institutions have emerged as National Institute of Health (NIH) grant-funded programs. As a result, the American chiropractic institutions have seen a retrenchment in the number of active research programs. In addition, although research training programs e.g., NIH's K awards are available for CIH researchers, these programs generally result in these researchers leaving their institutions and depriving future CIH practitioners of the benefit of being trained in a culture of research. One proposed solution is to leverage the substantial research infrastructure and long history of collaboration available at the RAND Corporation (https://www.rand.org) This article presents the proposed five components of the RAND Center for Collaborative CIH Research and the steps required to bring it to being: 1) the CIH Research Network - an online resource and collaborative site for CIH researchers; 2) the CIH Research Advisory Board - the governing body for the Center selected by its members; 3) the RAND CIH Interest Group - a group of RAND researchers with an interest in and who could provide support to CIH research; 4) CIH Researcher Training - access to existing RAND research training as well as the potential for the Center to provide a research training home for those with training grants; and 5) CIH RAND Partnership for Research - a mentorship program to support successful CIH research. By necessity the first step in the Center's creation would be a meeting between the heads of interested CIH institutions to work out the details and to obtain buy-in. The future success of CIH-directed research on CIH will require a pooling of talent and resources across institutions; something that the American chiropractic institutions have not yet been able to achieve.

31250882,Isoform function prediction based on bi-random walks on a heterogeneous network.,"MOTIVATION:Alternative splicing contributes to the functional diversity of protein species and the proteoforms translated from alternatively spliced isoforms of a gene actually execute the biological functions. Computationally predicting the functions of genes has been studied for decades. However, how to distinguish the functional annotations of isoforms, whose annotations are essential for understanding developmental abnormalities and cancers, is rarely explored. The main bottleneck is that functional annotations of isoforms are generally unavailable and functional genomic databases universally store the functional annotations at the gene level. RESULTS:We propose IsoFun to accomplish Isoform Function prediction based on bi-random walks on a heterogeneous network. IsoFun firstly constructs an isoform functional association network based on the expression profiles of isoforms derived from multiple RNA-seq datasets. Next, IsoFun uses the available Gene Ontology annotations of genes, gene-gene interactions and the relations between genes and isoforms to construct a heterogeneous network. After this, IsoFun performs a tailored bi-random walk on the heterogeneous network to predict the association between GO terms and isoforms, thus accomplishing the prediction of GO annotations of isoforms. Experimental results show that IsoFun significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms and improves the area under the receiver-operating curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 17% and 44% at the gene-level, respectively.

31307061,PRSice-2: Polygenic Risk Score software for biobank-scale data.,"<h4>Background</h4>Polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses have become an integral part of biomedical research, exploited to gain insights into shared aetiology among traits, to control for genomic profile in experimental studies, and to strengthen causal inference, among a range of applications. Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required.<h4>Results</h4>Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software program for automating and simplifying PRS analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models, and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative PRS software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PRSice-2's combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated, e.g., when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene set-based analyses. PRSice-2 is written in C++, with an R script for plotting, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31368479,Bayesian estimation of genetic regulatory effects in high-throughput reporter assays.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>High-throughput reporter assays dramatically improve our ability to assign function to noncoding genetic variants, by measuring allelic effects on gene expression in the controlled setting of a reporter gene. Unlike genetic association tests, such assays are not confounded by linkage disequilibrium when loci are independently assayed. These methods can thus improve the identification of causal disease mutations. While work continues on improving experimental aspects of these assays, less effort has gone into developing methods for assessing the statistical significance of assay results, particularly in the case of rare variants captured from patient DNA.<h4>Results</h4>We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model, called Bayesian Inference of Regulatory Differences, which integrates prior information and explicitly accounts for variability between experimental replicates. The model produces substantially more accurate predictions than existing methods when allele frequencies are low, which is of clear advantage in the search for disease-causing variants in DNA captured from patient cohorts. Using the model, we demonstrate a clear tradeoff between variant sequencing coverage and numbers of biological replicates, and we show that the use of additional biological replicates decreases variance in estimates of effect size, due to the properties of the Poisson-binomial distribution. We also provide a power and sample size calculator, which facilitates decision making in experimental design parameters.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The software is freely available from www.geneprediction.org/bird.

31400221,Alternating EM algorithm for a bilinear model in isoform quantification from RNA-seq data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Estimation of isoform-level gene expression from RNA-seq data depends on simplifying assumptions, such as uniform read distribution, that are easily violated in real data. Such violations typically lead to biased estimates. Most existing methods provide bias correction step(s), which is based on biological considerations-such as GC content-and applied in single samples separately. The main problem is that not all biases are known.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a novel method called XAEM based on a more flexible and robust statistical model. Existing methods are essentially based on a linear model X�, where the design matrix X is known and is computed based on the simplifying assumptions. In contrast XAEM considers X� as a bilinear model with both X and � unknown. Joint estimation of X and � is made possible by a simultaneous analysis of multi-sample RNA-seq data. Compared to existing methods, XAEM automatically performs empirical correction of potentially unknown biases. We use an alternating expectation-maximization (AEM) algorithm, alternating between estimation of X and �. For speed XAEM utilizes quasi-mapping for read alignment, thus leading to a fast algorithm. Overall XAEM performs favorably compared to recent advanced methods. For simulated datasets, XAEM obtains higher accuracy for multiple-isoform genes. In a differential-expression analysis of a real single-cell RNA-seq dataset, XAEM achieves substantially better rediscovery rates in independent validation sets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The method and pipeline are implemented as a tool and freely available for use at http://fafner.meb.ki.se/biostatwiki/xaem/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31431912,Data from quantitative serum proteomic analysis after laparoscopic gastric plication.,"Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for morbid obesity with a sustained weight loss and improvements in metabolic syndrome. We present a label free quantitative shotgun proteomics approach to analyze the serum proteome of obese people who underwent Laparoscopic Gastric Plication (LGP) as a new bariatric surgery. Pre-surgery serum samples of obese individuals were compared with the serum of the same subjects 1-2 months post-surgery (T1) and 4-5 months post-surgery (T2). The data provide a list of 224 quantifiable proteins with at least two unique peptides that were quantifiable in at least 70% of samples. Gene ontology biological processes and molecular functions of differentially regulated proteins between pre- and post-surgery samples were investigated using WebGestalt online tool. In addition, molecular networks of differentially abundant proteins were determined through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software.

31439548,Meflin-Positive Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Inhibit Pancreatic Carcinogenesis.,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) constitute a major component of the tumor microenvironment. Recent observations in genetically engineered mouse models and clinical studies have suggested that there may exist at least two functionally different populations of CAFs, that is, cancer-promoting CAFs (pCAF) and cancer-restraining CAFs (rCAF). Although various pCAF markers have been identified, the identity of rCAFs remains unknown because of the lack of rCAF-specific marker(s). In this study, we found that Meflin, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein that is a marker of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells and maintains their undifferentiated state, is expressed by pancreatic stellate cells that are a source of CAFs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). <i>In situ</i> hybridization analysis of 71 human PDAC tissues revealed that the infiltration of Meflin-positive CAFs correlated with favorable patient outcome. Consistent herewith, Meflin deficiency led to significant tumor progression with poorly differentiated histology in a PDAC mouse model. Similarly, genetic ablation of Meflin-positive CAFs resulted in poor differentiation of tumors in a syngeneic transplantation model. Conversely, delivery of a Meflin-expressing lentivirus into the tumor stroma or overexpression of Meflin in CAFs suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors. Lineage tracing revealed that Meflin-positive cells gave rise to a-smooth muscle actin-positive CAFs that are positive or negative for Meflin, suggesting a mechanism for generating CAF heterogeneity. Meflin deficiency or low expression resulted in straightened stromal collagen fibers, which represent a signature for aggressive tumors, in mouse or human PDAC tissues, respectively. Together, the data suggest that Meflin is a marker of rCAFs that suppress PDAC progression. SIGNIFICANCE: Meflin marks and functionally contributes to a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts that exert antitumoral effects.<b>Graphical Abstract:</b> http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/20/5367/F1.large.jpg.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31448721,Renal length and volume prediction in healthy children.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Little information is available regarding the evaluation of renal volume in healthy Latin-American children of different ages. The objective of this work was to establish a predictive model of renal size (volume and length) and develop a web-based calculator.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A selective and representative sample was obtained randomly from the database of healthy children living in Resistencia city, Chaco, Argentina: a) the National Health Program for children under 6 years old; b)�school children until 18 years old (primary and middle education). Renal dimensions were obtained by ultrasonography via a single experienced operator at the indicated site (schools or primary health care centers). Renal volume was calculated using Dinkel's formula. A multiple linear regression model was applied using potential predictors. The final model was implemented in a free web-based application.<h4>Results</h4>Random selection was made from the database to include 882 subjects with ages between 0.03 and 230.63 months. The data was divided into two sets (one for training and the other for model testing). The training set (423) included 212 (50%) females. Significant predictors included age, height, current weight and birth weight, and the interaction between age and present weight. Using the test dataset, both renal volume and length root mean square errors were 5.06 cm<sup>3</sup> and 0.59 cm.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prediction model was accurate and allowed for the development a freely-available web app: Renal size prediction (https://porbm28.shinyapps.io/RenalVolume/). Once the models are validated by additional studies, the app could be a useful tool to predict renal volume and length in pediatric clinical practice.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31508533,Magnesium supplementation therapy to prevent cisplatin-induced acute nephrotoxicity in pediatric cancer: A protocol for a randomized phase 2 trial.,"Although cisplatin is one of the most effective agents against various pediatric cancers, it is sometimes difficult to manage due to its dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. Magnesium sulfate (Mg) showed a kidney-protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) by regulating renal platinum accumulation both in vitro and in vivo, and the body of clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of this drug in adult cancer patients is increasing.In this open, multicenter, phase-2, randomized trial, patients under age 18 years who are scheduled to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy will be enrolled and randomly allocated either to an Mg supplementation arm in even-numbered chemotherapy courses (arm AB) or to another arm in odd-numbered courses (arm BA), with a 1:1 allocation. Analysis objects will be reconstructed into two groups depending on whether the chemotherapy course has Mg supplementation (group B) or not (group A). The primary endpoint is the proportion of chemotherapy courses resulting in elevated serum creatinine equal to or greater than 50% of the prechemotherapy value. For the secondary endpoints, various parameters for measuring kidney function, such as serum cystatin-C, B2M, L-FABP, NGAL, and urinary NAG in the two groups will be compared. A sample size based on alpha�=�5% and 80% power requires at least 40 samples per group (ideally, 60 samples per group).If Mg demonstrates efficacy, a phase-3 study to confirm the prophylactic effect of Mg supplementation in both acute and chronic CIN will be developed using novel and better biomarkers.

31573931,Development of Ovarian Tissue Autograft to Restore Ovarian Function: Protocol for a French Multicenter Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND:Sterility is a major late effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments. Iatrogenic sterility is often permanent and greatly impacts long-term quality of life. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) performed before gonadotoxic treatments with subsequent autograft is a method of fertility preservation available for girls and women. Its application in prepubertal girls is of particular value as it is the only possible approach in this patient group. In addition, it does not require a delay in cancer therapy and no ovarian stimulation is needed. OBJECTIVE:The primary aim of this protocol is to help increase the implementation of ovarian tissue autografting in France. Knowledge is still lacking regarding the efficacy of ovarian transplantation in restoring ovarian function and regarding the safety of this procedure, especially the risk of cancer cell reseeding in certain types of cancer. A secondary aim of this study is to generate data to improve our understanding of these two essential aspects. METHODS:The DATOR (Development of Ovarian Tissue Autograft in Order to Restore Ovarian Function) study is ongoing in 17 university hospitals. The DATOR protocol includes the autograft of ovarian cortex fragments. Candidates are identified from an observational prospective cohort (called the Prospective Cohort of Patients Candidates for Ovarian Tissue Autograft [PERIDATOR]) of patients who have undergone OTC. Enrollment in the study is initiated at the patient's request and must be validated by the center's multidisciplinary team and by the study steering committee. The DATOR study begins with a total medical checkup. Ovarian tissue qualification and residual disease detection, if required, are performed. RESULTS:The study is ongoing. Currently, 38 patients have provided informed consent and have been entered into the DATOR study. Graft has been performed for 34 of these patients. An interim analysis was conducted on the first 25 patients for whom the period of at least 1 year posttransplantation was achieved. Out of these 25 patients, 11 women succeeded in becoming pregnant (pregnancy rate=44% [11/25]; delivery rate=40% [10/25]). Among these, 6 women conceived twice, and 1 pregnancy led to a miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS:Our preliminary analysis appears to be coherent with the accumulating body of evidence indicating the potential utility of ovarian tissue autograft for patients with premature ovarian failure. All these elements justify the pursuit of our study. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02846064; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02846064.

31633588,Widespread Pain Is Associated with Increased Risk of No Clinical Improvement After TKA in Women.,"<h4>Background</h4>When conservative treatments do not work, TKA may be the best option for patients with knee osteoarthritis, although a relatively large proportion of individuals do not have clinically important improvement after TKA. Evidence also suggests that women are less likely to benefit from TKA than men, but the reasons are unclear. Widespread pain disproportionately affects women and has been associated with worse outcomes after joint arthroplasty, yet it is unknown if the effect of widespread pain on TKA outcomes differs by patient gender.<h4>Questions/purposes</h4>(1) Does the association between widespread pain and no clinically important improvement in osteoarthritis-related pain and disability 2 years after TKA differ between men and women? (2) Does the use of pain medications 2 years after TKA differ between those with widespread pain and those without widespread pain before surgery?<h4>Methods</h4>Osteoarthritis Initiative (https://nda.nih.gov/oai/) study participants were followed annually from March 2005 until October 2015. Participants who underwent TKA up to the 7-year follow-up visit with pain/disability assessment at the protocol-planned visit before TKA and at the second planned annual visit after surgery were included in the analysis. Among 4796 study participants, 391 had a confirmed TKA, including 315 with pain/disability assessment at the protocol-planned visit before TKA. Overall, 95% of participants (298) had the required follow-up assessment; 5% (17) did not have follow-up data. Widespread pain was defined based on the modified American College of Rheumatology criteria. Symptoms were assessed using the WOMAC pain (range 0 to 20; higher score, more pain) and disability (range 0 to 68; higher score, more disability) scores, and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (range 0 to 100; higher score, less pain). Improvements in pain and disability were classified based on improvement from established clinically important differences (decrease in WOMAC pain = 1.5; decrease in WOMAC disability = 6.0; increase in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain = 9). At baseline, more women presented with widespread pain than men (45% [84 of 184] versus 32% [36 of 114]). Probability and the relative risk (RR) of no clinically important improvement were estimated using a logistic regression analysis in which participants with widespread pain and those without were compared. The analyses were done for men and women separately, then adjusted for depression and baseline outcome scores.<h4>Results</h4>Among women, preoperative widespread pain was associated with an increased risk of no clinically important improvement 2 years after TKA, based on WOMAC pain scores (13.5% versus 4.6%; RR 2.93 [95% CI 1.18 to 7.30]; p = 0.02) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (16.5% versus 4.9%; RR 3.39 [95% CI 1.34 to 8.59]; p = 0.02). Given the lower and upper limits of the confidence intervals, our data are compatible with a broad range of disparate associations between widespread pain and lack of clinically important improvement in WOMAC pain scores (RR 0.77 [95% CI 0.22 to 2.70]; p = 0.68) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for pain (RR 1.37 [95% CI 0.47 to 4.00]; p = 0.57) among men, as well as clinically important improvement in WOMAC disability scores among men (RR 0.72 [95% CI 0.20 to 2.55]; p = 0.61) and women (RR 1.98 [95% CI 0.92 to 4.26]; p = 0.08). Participants presenting with widespread pain before TKA were more likely than those without widespread pain to use medication for symptoms of knee osteoarthritis most days for at least 1 month 2 years after TKA (51% [61 of 120] versus 32% [57 of 178]; mean difference, 18.8 [95% CI 7.3 to 30.1]; p < 0.01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Widespread pain before TKA was associated with an increased risk of no clinically important improvement in knee pain 2 years postoperatively among women. Because of the small number of men with widespread pain in the sample, the results for men were inconclusive. In clinical practice, screening TKA candidates for widespread pain may be useful, and expectations of surgical outcomes may need to be tempered if patients have a concurrent diagnosis of widespread pain. Future studies should include more men with widespread pain and investigate if treatment of widespread pain before or concurrent with TKA surgery may improve surgical outcomes.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Level III, therapeutic study.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

31784425,Single-Cell Gene Expression Analyses Reveal Distinct Self-Renewing and Proliferating Subsets in the Leukemia Stem Cell Compartment in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"Standard chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) targets proliferative cells and efficiently induces complete remission; however, many patients relapse and die of their disease. Relapse is caused by leukemia stem cells (LSC), the cells with self-renewal capacity. Self-renewal and proliferation are separate functions in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in steady-state conditions. If these functions are also separate functions in LSCs, then antiproliferative therapies may fail to target self-renewal, allowing for relapse. We investigated whether proliferation and self-renewal are separate functions in LSCs as they often are in HSCs. Distinct transcriptional profiles within LSCs of Mll-AF9/NRASG12V murine AML were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing. Single-cell qPCR revealed that these genes were also differentially expressed in primary human LSCs and normal human HSPCs. A smaller subset of these genes was upregulated in LSCs relative to HSPCs; this subset of genes constitutes """"LSC-specific"""" genes in human AML. To assess the differences between these profiles, we identified cell surface markers, CD69 and CD36, whose genes were differentially expressed between these profiles. In vivo mouse reconstitution assays resealed that only CD69High LSCs were capable of self-renewal and were poorly proliferative. In contrast, CD36High LSCs were unable to transplant leukemia but were highly proliferative. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional foundations of self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in LSCs as they often are in normal stem cells and suggest that therapeutic strategies that target self-renewal, in addition to proliferation, are critical to prevent relapse and improve survival in AML. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings define and functionally validate a self-renewal gene profile of leukemia stem cells at the single-cell level and demonstrate that self-renewal and proliferation are distinct in AML.

31833063,Influence of mental stress and environmental toxins on circadian clocks: Implications for redox regulation of the heart and cardioprotection.,"Risk factors in the environment such as air pollution and mental stress contribute to the development of chronic non-communicable disease. Air pollution was identified as the leading health risk factor in the physical environment, followed by water pollution, soil pollution/heavy metals/chemicals and occupational exposures, however neglecting the non-chemical environmental health risk factors (e.g. mental stress and noise). Epidemiological data suggest that environmental risk factors are associated with higher risk for cardiovascular, metabolic and mental diseases, including hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes, arrhythmia, stroke, depression and anxiety disorders. We provide an overview on the impact of the external exposome comprising risk factors/exposures on cardiovascular health with a focus on dysregulation of stress hormones, mitochondrial function, redox balance and inflammation with special emphasis on the circadian clock.

With the increase in treatment options, risk-adapted therapy is becoming more and more important. Survival analysis is commonly applied to study progression or other events of interest and stratify the risk of patients. RESULTS:In this study, we present the current state-of-the-art model for MM prognosis and the molecular biomarker set for stratification: the winning algorithm in the 2017 Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge, Sub-Challenge 3. Specifically, we built a non-parametric complete hazard ranking model to map the right-censored data into a linear space, where commonplace machine learning techniques, such as Gaussian process regression and random forests, can play their roles. Our model integrated both the gene expression profile and clinical features to predict the progression of MM. Compared with conventional models, such as Cox model and random survival forests, our model achieved higher accuracy in 3 within-cohort predictions. In addition, it showed robust predictive power in cross-cohort validations. Key molecular signatures related to MM progression were identified from our model, which may function as the core determinants of MM progression and provide important guidance for future research and clinical practice. Functional enrichment analysis and mammalian gene-gene interaction network revealed crucial biological processes and pathways involved in MM progression. The model is dockerized and publicly available at https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn11459638. Both data and reproducible code are included in the docker.

National surveys report that inpatient rehabilitation for older people is a core function but there are large differences in key performance measures. We have investigated these variations in community hospital ward performance.<h4>Objectives</h4>(1) To measure the relative performance of community hospital wards (studies 1 and 2); (2) to identify characteristics of community hospital wards that optimise performance (studies 1 and 3); (3) to develop a web-based interactive toolkit that supports operational changes to optimise ward performance (study 4); (4) to investigate the impact of community hospital wards on secondary care use (study 5); and (5) to investigate associations between short-term community (intermediate care) services and secondary care utilisation (study 5).<h4>Methods</h4>Study 1 � we used national data to conduct econometric estimations using stochastic frontier analysis in which a cost function was modelled using significant predictors of community hospital ward costs. Study 2 � a national postal survey was developed to collect data from a larger sample of community hospitals. Study 3 � three ethnographic case studies were performed to provide insight into less tangible aspects of community hospital ward care. Study 4 � a web-based interactive toolkit was developed by integrating the econometrics (study 1) and case study (study 3) findings. Study 5 � regression analyses were conducted using data from the Atlas of Variation Map 61 (rate of emergency admissions to hospital for people aged = 75 years with a length of stay of < 24 hours) and the National Audit of Intermediate Care.<h4>Results</h4>Community hospital ward efficiency is comparable with the NHS acute hospital sector (mean cost efficiency 0.83, range 0.72�0.92). The rank order of community hospital ward efficiencies was distinguished to facilitate learning across the sector. On average, if all community hospital wards were operating in line with the highest cost efficiency, savings of 17% (or �47M per year) could be achieved (price year 2013/14) for our sample of 101 wards. Significant economies of scale were found: a 1% rise in output was associated with an average 0.85% increase in costs. We were unable to obtain a larger community hospital sample because of the low response rate to our national survey. The case studies identified how rehabilitation was delivered through collaborative, interdisciplinary working; interprofessional communication; and meaningful patient and family engagement. We also developed insight into patients� recovery trajectories and care transitions. The web-based interactive toolkit was established [http://mocha.nhsbenchmarking.nhs.uk/ (accessed 9 September 2019)]. The crisis response team type of intermediate care, but not community hospitals, had a statistically significant negative association with emergency admissions.<h4>Limitations</h4>The econometric analyses were based on cross-sectional data and were also limited by missing data. The low response rate to our national survey means that we cannot extrapolate reliably from our community hospital sample.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results suggest that significant community hospital ward savings may be realised by improving modifiable performance factors that might be augmented further by economies of scale.<h4>Future work</h4>How less efficient hospitals might reduce costs and sustain quality requires further research.<h4>Funding</h4>This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research programme and will be published in full in Health Services and Delivery Research; Vol. 8, No. 1.

31921518,A transcriptomic study of probenecid on injured spinal cords in mice.,"Background:Recent studies have found that probenecid has neuroprotective and reparative effects on central nervous system injuries. However, its effect on genome-wide transcription in acute spinal cord injury (SCI) remains unknown. In the present study, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is used to analyze the effect of probenecid on the local expression of gene transcription 8 h after spinal injury. Methods:An Infinite Horizon impactor was used to perform contusive SCI in mice. The SCI model was made by using a rod (1.3 mm diameter) with a force of 50 Kdynes. Sham-operated mice only received a laminectomy without contusive injury. The injured mice were randomly assigned into either the control (SCI_C) or probenecid injection (SCI_P) group. In the latter group, the probenecid drug was intraperitoneally injected (0.5 mg/kg) immediately following injury. Eight hours after the injury or laminectomy, the spinal cords were removed from the mice in both groups. The total RNAs were extracted and purified for library preparation and transcriptome sequencing. Differential gene expressions (DEGs) of the three groups-sham, SCI_C and SCI_P-were analyzed using a DESeq software. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed using a GOseq R package and KOBAS software. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to validate RNA-Seq results. Results:RNA-Seq showed that, compared to the SCI_C group, the number of DEGs was 641 in the SCI_P group (286 upregulated and 355 downregulated). According to GO analysis, DEGs were most enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen trimer, protein bounding and sequence specific DNA binding. KEGG analysis showed that the most enriched pathways included: cell adhesion molecules, Leukocyte transendothelial migration, ECM-receptor interactions, PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, hematopoietic cell lineages, focal adhesions, the Rap1 signaling pathway, etc. The sequence data have been deposited into the Sequence Read Archive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/PRJNA554464).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced
32022843,FTIP: an accurate and efficient method for global protein surface comparison.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Global protein surface comparison (GPSC) studies have been limited compared to other research works on protein structure alignment/comparison due to lack of real applications associated with GPSC. However, the technology advances in cryo-electron tomography (CET) have made methods to identify proteins from their surface shapes extremely useful.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we developed a new method called Farthest point sampling (FPS)-enhanced Triangulation-based Iterative-closest-Point (ICP) (FTIP) for GPSC. We applied it to protein classification using only surface shape information. Our method first extracts a set of feature points from protein surfaces using FPS and then uses a triangulation-based efficient ICP algorithm to align the feature points of the two proteins to be compared. Tested on a benchmark dataset with 2329 proteins using nearest-neighbor classification, FTIP outperformed the state-of-the-art method for GPSC based on 3D Zernike descriptors. Using real and simulated cryo-EM data, we show that FTIP could be applied in the future to address problems in protein identification in CET experiments.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Programs/scripts we developed/used in the study are available at http://ani.stat.fsu.edu/~yuan/index.fld/FTIP.tar.bz2.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32025087,Reassessing Southern Ocean Air-Sea CO2 Flux Estimates With the Addition of Biogeochemical Float Observations.,"New estimates of pCO2 from profiling floats deployed by the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project have demonstrated the importance of wintertime outgassing south of the Polar Front, challenging the accepted magnitude of Southern Ocean carbon uptake (Gray et al., 2018, https://doi:10.1029/2018GL078013). Here, we put 3.5 years of SOCCOM observations into broader context with the global surface carbon dioxide database (Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas, SOCAT) by using the two interpolation methods currently used to assess the ocean models in the Global Carbon Budget (Le Qu�r� et al., 2018, https://doi:10.5194/essd-10-2141-2018) to create a ship-only, a float-weighted, and a combined estimate of Southern Ocean carbon fluxes (<35�S). In our ship-only estimate, we calculate a mean uptake of -1.14 � 0.19 Pg C/yr for 2015-2017, consistent with prior studies. The float-weighted estimate yields a significantly lower Southern Ocean uptake of -0.35 � 0.19 Pg C/yr. Subsampling of high-resolution ocean biogeochemical process models indicates that some of the differences between float and ship-only estimates of the Southern Ocean carbon flux can be explained by spatial and temporal sampling differences. The combined ship and float estimate minimizes the root-mean-square pCO2 difference between the mapped product and both data sets, giving a new Southern Ocean uptake of -0.75 � 0.22 Pg C/yr, though with uncertainties that overlap the ship-only estimate. An atmospheric inversion reveals that a shift of this magnitude in the contemporary Southern Ocean carbon flux must be compensated for by ocean or land sinks within the Southern Hemisphere.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32043185,Metabolic alterations in immune cells associate with progression to type 1 diabetes.,"<h4>Aims/hypothesis</h4>Previous metabolomics studies suggest that type 1 diabetes is preceded by specific metabolic disturbances. The aim of this study was to investigate whether distinct metabolic patterns occur in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of children who later develop pancreatic beta cell autoimmunity or overt type 1 diabetes.<h4>Methods</h4>In a longitudinal cohort setting, PBMC metabolomic analysis was applied in children who (1) progressed to type 1 diabetes (PT1D, n = 34), (2) seroconverted to =1 islet autoantibody without progressing to type 1 diabetes (P1Ab, n = 27) or (3) remained autoantibody negative during follow-up (CTRL, n = 10).<h4>Results</h4>During the first year of life, levels of most lipids and polar metabolites were lower in the PT1D and P1Ab groups compared with the CTRL group. Pathway over-representation analysis suggested alanine, aspartate, glutamate, glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism were over-represented in PT1D. Genome-scale metabolic models of PBMCs during type 1 diabetes progression were developed by using publicly available transcriptomics data and constrained with metabolomics data from our study. Metabolic modelling confirmed altered ceramide pathways, known to play an important role in immune regulation, as specifically associated with type 1 diabetes progression.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our data suggest that systemic dysregulation of lipid metabolism, as observed in plasma, may impact the metabolism and function of immune cells during progression to overt type 1 diabetes.<h4>Data availability</h4>The GEMs for PBMCs have been submitted to BioModels (www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), under accession number MODEL1905270001. The metabolomics datasets and the clinical metadata generated in this study were submitted to MetaboLights (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/), under accession number MTBLS1015.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced
32078592,"Characteristics and Health Status of Informal Unpaid Caregivers - 44 States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, 2015-2017.","In 2015, an estimated 17.7 million U.S. persons were informal caregivers who provided substantial services through in-home, unpaid assistance to their family members and friends (1). Caregiving can have many benefits, such as enhancing the bond between caregiver and recipient, but it can also place an emotional and physical strain on caregivers, leading to higher rates of depression, lower quality of life, and poorer overall health (2). As the U.S. population continues to age (3), the need for informal caregivers will likely increase. However, little nationally representative information on prevalence of caregivers is available. This study examined demographic characteristics and health status of informal caregivers from 44 states,* the District of Columbia (DC), and Puerto Rico, based on data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collected during 2015-2017. Overall, approximately one in five adults reported that they had provided care to a family member or friend in the preceding 30 days. Fifty-eight percent of caregivers were women, and a majority were non-Hispanic white, with at least some college education, and married or living with a partner. Across all states, 19.2% of caregivers reported being in fair or poor health, although significant state-to-state variation occurred. Caregivers provide important support to family members, friends, and the health care system and might compromise their own health to provide this support (1,2). Better understanding of caregivers and the challenges they face could inform implementation of improvements in support systems that could enhance not only the health of the caregiver, but that of the care recipient as well. For example, additional data regarding demographics at the state level might aid in more effective planning and support of caregivers with evidence-based programs and assistance (https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/caring-for-yourself.html).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,public health
32130122,Feasibility of an Electronic Health Tool to Promote Physical Activity in Primary Care: Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Physical inactivity is associated with increased health risks. Primary care providers (PCPs) are well positioned to support increased physical activity (PA) levels through screening and provision of PA prescriptions. However, PCP counseling on PA is not common. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing an electronic health (eHealth) tool to support PA counseling by PCPs and estimate intervention effectiveness on patients' PA levels. METHODS:A pragmatic pilot study was conducted using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design. The study was conducted at a single primary care clinic, with 4 pre-existing PCP teams. Adult patients who had a periodic health review (PHR) scheduled during the study period were invited to participate. The eHealth tool involved an electronic survey sent to participants before their PHR via an email or a tablet; data were used to automatically produce tailored resources and a PA prescription in the electronic medical record of participants in the intervention arm. Participants assigned to the control arm received usual care from their PCP. Feasibility was assessed by the proportion of completed surveys and patient-reported acceptability and fidelity measures. The primary effectiveness outcome was patient-reported PA at 4 months post-PHR, measured as metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week. Secondary outcomes assessed determinants of PA, including self-efficacy and intention to change based on the Health Action Process Approach behavior change theory. RESULTS:A total of 1028 patients receiving care from 34 PCPs were invited to participate and 530 (51.55%) consented (intervention [n=296] and control [n=234]). Of the participants who completed a process evaluation, almost half (88/178, 49.4%) stated they received a PA prescription, with only 42 receiving the full intervention including tailored resources from their PCP. A cluster-level linear regression analysis yielded a non-statistically significant positive difference in MET-minutes reported per week at follow-up between intervention and control conditions (mean difference 1027; 95% CI -155 to 2209; P=.09). No statistically significant differences were observed for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that it is feasible to build an eHealth tool that screens and provides tailored resources for PA in a primary care setting but suboptimal intervention fidelity suggests greater work must be done to address PCP barriers to resource distribution. Participant responses to the primary effectiveness outcome (MET-minutes) were highly variable, reflecting a need for more robust measures of PA in future trials to address limitations in patient-reported data.

32130186,A 21-Day School-Based Toothbrushing Intervention in Children Aged 6 to 9 Years in Indonesia and Nigeria: Protocol for a Two-Arm Superiority Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:The World Health Organization reports that dental cavities affect 60% to 90% of children globally. FDI World Dental Federation and Unilever Oral Care have developed public health programs to improve brushing habits over their 12-year partnership. The last of these (phase III) named Brush Day & Night aimed to educate children on brushing twice daily with a fluoride toothpaste and gave useful information for a new project, phase IV. The 21-day Brush Day & Night program is an intense education activity designed to establish the habit of brushing day and night with a fluoride toothpaste. The program involves daily brushing instruction and includes free toothpaste and toothbrushes. OBJECTIVE:The main objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a 21-day school program on children's oral health. As a secondary objective, we aim to evaluate the impact on the knowledge, behavior, toothbrushing habits, and quality of life in school children aged 6 to 9 years after a 21-day school program and compare with baseline and a control group as measured by the self-reported questionnaires issued to children (in particular, the self-reported brushing frequency and positive responses on fluoridated toothpaste use). The enduring nature of the program will be determined by the inclusion of 8- and 24-week time points. METHODS:The study is a 2-arm superiority randomized controlled trial. Clusters in this study are infant and junior schools in Indonesia and Nigeria. The study aims to recruit 20 schools with children aged 6 to 9 years in each country. At baseline, children in both intervention and control schools will answer a questionnaire and have their clinical oral health assessed using the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI) and Decayed Missing and Filled Teeth index. Children in the intervention schools will then take part in a structured 21-day Brush Day & Night intervention. Children in the control schools will be provided with free toothpaste and toothbrushes but will not receive the 21-day intervention. The questionnaires and OHI assessments are repeated after the 21-day program is completed and again 8 weeks later and 24 weeks later for all participating children. Parents/carers/guardians of all children will sign the informed consent and complete questionnaires on their own experience and attitudes toward oral health and toothbrushing routine at each of the four times points (baseline, 21 days, 8 weeks, and 24 weeks). The study will be conducted by the national dental associations of Indonesia and Nigeria and was approved by the ethics committees of both countries. RESULTS:The study is ongoing. Recruitment of schools started in Indonesia in February 2018 and in Nigeria in April 2018 for the first part of the study, which concluded in Indonesia in September 2018 and in Nigeria in November 2018. The second part of the study (the second half of the schools) started in November 2018 in Indonesia and December 2018 in Nigeria.

32139710,"Classification models for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Progression, based on gene expression data-trained supervised machine learning.","Early detection of breast cancer and its correct stage determination are important for prognosis and rendering appropriate personalized clinical treatment to breast cancer patients. However, despite considerable efforts and progress, there is a need to identify the specific genomic factors responsible for, or accompanying Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) progression stages, which can aid the determination of the correct cancer stages. We have developed two-class machine-learning classification models to differentiate the early and late stages of IDC. The prediction models are trained with RNA-seq gene expression profiles representing different IDC stages of 610 patients, obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Different supervised learning algorithms were trained and evaluated with an enriched model learning, facilitated by different feature selection methods. We also developed a machine-learning classifier trained on the same datasets with training sets reduced data corresponding to IDC driver genes. Based on these two classifiers, we have developed a web-server Duct-BRCA-CSP to predict early stage from late stages of IDC based on input RNA-seq gene expression profiles. The analysis conducted by us also enables deeper insights into the stage-dependent molecular events accompanying IDC progression. The server is publicly available at http://bioinfo.icgeb.res.in/duct-BRCA-CSP.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32166213,Machine learning with force-field inspired descriptors for materials: fast screening and mapping energy landscape.,"We present a complete set of chemo-structural descriptors to significantly extend the applicability of machine-learning (ML) in material screening and mapping energy landscape for multicomponent systems. These new descriptors allow differentiating between structural prototypes, which is not possible using the commonly used chemical-only descriptors. Specifically, we demonstrate that the combination of pairwise radial, nearest neighbor, bond-angle, dihedral-angle and core-charge distributions plays an important role in predicting formation energies, bandgaps, static refractive indices, magnetic properties, and modulus of elasticity for three-dimensional (3D) materials as well as exfoliation energies of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. The training data consists of 24549 bulk and 616 monolayer materials taken from JARVIS-DFT database. We obtained very accurate ML models using gradient boosting algorithm. Then we use the trained models to discover exfoliable 2D-layered materials satisfying specific property requirements. Additionally, we integrate our formation energy ML model with a genetic algorithm for structure search to verify if the ML model reproduces the DFT convex hull. This verification establishes a more stringent evaluation metric for the ML model than what commonly used in data sciences. Our learnt model is publicly available on the JARVIS-ML website (https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/jarvisml) property predictions of generalized materials.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32175316,RF-PseU: A Random Forest Predictor for RNA Pseudouridine Sites.,"One of the ubiquitous chemical modifications in RNA, pseudouridine modification is crucial for various cellular biological and physiological processes. To gain more insight into the functional mechanisms involved, it is of fundamental importance to precisely identify pseudouridine sites in RNA. Several useful machine learning approaches have become available recently, with the increasing progress of next-generation sequencing technology; however, existing methods cannot predict sites with high accuracy. Thus, a more accurate predictor is required. In this study, a random forest-based predictor named RF-PseU is proposed for prediction of pseudouridylation sites. To optimize feature representation and obtain a better model, the light gradient boosting machine algorithm and incremental feature selection strategy were used to select the optimum feature space vector for training the random forest model RF-PseU. Compared with previous state-of-the-art predictors, the results on the same benchmark data sets of three species demonstrate that RF-PseU performs better overall. The integrated average leave-one-out cross-validation and independent testing accuracy scores were 71.4% and 74.7%, respectively, representing increments of 3.63% and 4.77% versus the best existing predictor. Moreover, the final RF-PseU model for prediction was built on leave-one-out cross-validation and provides a reliable and robust tool for identifying pseudouridine sites.

32186404,"Uterine Patterning, Endometrial Gland Development, and Implantation Failure in Mice Exposed Neonatally to Genistein.","BACKGROUND:Embryo implantation relies on precise hormonal regulation, associated gene expression changes, and appropriate female reproductive tract tissue architecture. Female mice exposed neonatally to the phytoestrogen genistein (GEN) at doses similar to those in infants consuming soy-based infant formulas are infertile due in part to uterine implantation defects. OBJECTIVES:Our goal was to determine the mechanisms by which neonatal GEN exposure causes implantation defects. METHODS:Female mice were exposed to GEN on postnatal days (PND)1-5 and uterine tissues collected on PND5, PND22-26, and during pregnancy. Analysis of tissue weights, morphology, and gene expression was performed using standard histology, confocal imaging with three-dimensional analysis, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), and microarrays. The response of ovariectomized adults to 17�-estradiol (E2) and artificial decidualization were measured. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) injections were given intraperitoneally and implantation sites visualized. Gene expression patterns were compared with curated data sets to identify upstream regulators. RESULTS:GEN-exposed mice exhibited reduced uterine weight gain in response to E2 treatment or artificial decidualization compared with controls; however, expression of select hormone responsive genes remained similar between the two groups. Uteri from pregnant GEN-exposed mice were posteriorized and had reduced glandular epithelium. Implantation failure was not rescued by LIF administration. Microarray analysis of GEN-exposed uteri during early pregnancy revealed significant overlap with several conditional uterine knockout mouse models, including Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17. These models exhibit reduced endometrial glands, features of posteriorization and implantation failure. Expression of Foxa2, Wnt4, and Sox17, as well as genes important for neonatal uterine differentiation (Wnt7a, Hoxa10, and Msx2), were severely disrupted on PND5 in GEN-exposed mice. DISCUSSION:Our findings suggest that neonatal GEN exposure in mice disrupts expression of genes important for uterine development, causing posteriorization and diminished gland function during pregnancy that contribute to implantation failure. These findings could have implications for women who consumed soy-based formulas as infants. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6336.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32214380,Stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for visualization and estimation of transcriptional kinetics.,"Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescent imaging have enabled quantitative measurements of transcription at a single gene copy, yet an accurate understanding of transcriptional kinetics is still lacking due to the difficulty of solving detailed biophysical models. Here we introduce a stochastic simulation and statistical inference platform for modeling detailed transcriptional kinetics in prokaryotic systems, which has not been solved analytically. The model includes stochastic two-state gene activation, mRNA synthesis initiation and stepwise elongation, release to the cytoplasm, and stepwise co-transcriptional degradation. Using the Gillespie algorithm, the platform simulates nascent and mature mRNA kinetics of a single gene copy and predicts fluorescent signals measurable by time-lapse single-cell mRNA imaging, for different experimental conditions. To approach the inverse problem of estimating the kinetic parameters of the model from experimental data, we develop a heuristic optimization method based on the genetic algorithm and the empirical distribution of mRNA generated by simulation. As a demonstration, we show that the optimization algorithm can successfully recover the transcriptional kinetics of simulated and experimental gene expression data.

32266474,Conjunctive reward-place coding properties of dorsal distal CA1 hippocampus cells.,"Autonomous motivated spatial navigation in animals or robots requires the association between spatial location and value. Hippocampal place cells are involved in goal-directed spatial navigation and the consolidation of spatial memories. Recently, Gauthier and Tank (Neuron 99(1):179-193, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.06.008) have identified a subpopulation of hippocampal cells selectively activated in relation to rewarded goals. However, the relationship between these cells' spiking activity and goal representation remains elusive. We analyzed data from experiments in which rats underwent five consecutive tasks in which reward locations and spatial context were manipulated. We found CA1 populations with properties continuously ranging from place cells to reward cells. Specifically, we found typical place cells insensitive to reward locations, reward cells that only fired at correct rewarded feeders in each task regardless of context, and """"hybrid cells"""" that responded to spatial locations and change of reward locations. Reward cells responded mostly to the reward delivery rather than to its expectation. In addition, we found a small group of neurons that transitioned between place and reward cells properties within the 5-task session. We conclude that some pyramidal cells (if not all) integrate both spatial and reward inputs to various degrees. These results provide insights into the integrative coding properties of CA1 pyramidal cells, focusing on their abilities to carry both spatial and reward information in a mixed and plastic manner. This conjunctive coding property prompts a re-thinking of current computational models of spatial navigation in which hippocampal spatial and subcortical value representations are independent.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32281541,Effects of the ACT OUT! Social Issue Theater Program on Social-Emotional Competence and Bullying in Youth and Adolescents: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND:Students in the United States spend a meaningful portion of their developmental lives in school. In recent years, researchers and educators have begun to focus explicitly on social and emotional learning (SEL) in the school setting. Initial evidence from meta-analyses suggests that curricula designed to promote SEL likely produce benefits in terms of social-emotional competence (SEC) and numerous related behavioral and affective outcomes. At the same time, there are often barriers to implementing such curricula as intended, and some researchers have questioned the strength of the evaluation data from SEL programs. As part of the effort to improve programming in SEL, this paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomized trial of the ACT OUT! Social Issue Theater program, a brief psychodramatic intervention to build SEC and reduce bullying behavior in students. OBJECTIVE:The objective of this trial is to examine if a short dose of interactive psychodrama can affect SEC metrics and bullying experiences in schoolchildren in either the short (2-week) or medium (6-month) term. METHODS:The ACT OUT! trial is a cluster randomized superiority trial with 2 parallel groups. The unit of measurement is the student, and the unit of randomization is the classroom. For each grade (fourth, seventh, and 10th), an even number of classrooms will be selected from each school-half will be assigned to the intervention arm and half will be assigned to the control arm. The intervention will consist of 3 moderated psychodramatic performances by trained actors, and the control condition will be the usual school day. Outcome data will be collected at baseline (preintervention), 2-week postintervention (short term), and 6-month postintervention (medium term). Outcomes will include social-emotional competency; self-reported bullying and experiences of being bullied; receptivity to the program; and school-level data on truancy, absenteeism, and referrals to school displinary action for bullying. A power analysis adjusted for clustering effect, design effect, and potential attrition yielded a need for approximately 1594 students, consisting of an estimated 80 classrooms split evenly into intervention and control arms. RESULTS:This study was funded in June 2019; approved by the Indiana University Institutional review board on September 17, 2019; began subject recruitment on November 5, 2019; and prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. CONCLUSIONS:Many states have issued recommendations for the integration of SEL into schools. The proposed study uses a rigorous methodology to determine if the ACT OUT! psychodramatic intervention is a cost-effective means of bolstering SEC and reducing bullying incidence in schools.

32293391,Evaluation of a computer-assisted multi-professional intervention to address lifestyle-related risk factors for overweight and obesity in expecting mothers and their infants: protocol for an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study.,"BACKGROUND:The first 1000 days after conception are a critical period to encourage lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of childhood obesity and early programming of chronic diseases. A healthy lifestyle during pregnancy is also crucial to avoid high post-partum weight retention. Currently, lifestyle changes are not consistently discussed during routine health services in Germany. The objective of this study is to evaluate a novel computer-assisted lifestyle intervention embedded in prenatal visits and infant check-ups. The intervention seeks to reduce lifestyle-related risk factors for overweight and obesity among expecting mothers and their infants. METHODS:The study is designed as a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to simultaneously collect data on the effectiveness and implementation of the lifestyle intervention. The trial will take place in eight regions of the German state Baden-Wuerttemberg. Region were matched using propensity score matching. Expecting mothers (n = 1860) will be recruited before 12 weeks of gestation through gynecological practices and followed for 18 months. During 11 routine prenatal visits and infant check-ups gynecologists, midwives and pediatricians provide lifestyle counseling using Motivational Interviewing techniques. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of expecting mothers with gestational weight gain within the recommended range. To understand the process of implementation (focus group) interviews will be conducted with providers and participants of the lifestyle intervention. Additionally, an analysis of administrative data and documents will be carried out. An economic analysis will provide insights into cost and consequences compared to routine health services. DISCUSSION:Findings of this study will add to the evidence on lifestyle interventions to reduce risk for overweight and obesity commenced during pregnancy. Insights gained will contribute to the prevention of early programming of chronic disease.

32297095,Using Complier Average Causal Effect Estimation to Examine Student Outcomes of the PAX Good Behavior Game When Integrated with the PATHS Curriculum.,"A growing body of research has documented a link between variation in implementation dosage and outcomes associated with preventive interventions. Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE; Jo in J Educ Behav Stat 27:385-409, 2002) analysis allows for estimating program impacts in light of variation in implementation. This study reports intent-to-treat (ITT) and CACE findings from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the impacts of the universal PAX Good Behavior Game (PAX GBG)�integrated with Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (i.e., PATHS to PAX) and PAX GBG only compared to a control. This study used ratings by 318�K-5 teachers of 1526 at-risk children who, at baseline, were rated as displaying the top 33rd percentile of aggressive-disruptive behavior. Leveraging a prior study on these data (Berg et al. in Admin Policy Ment Health Ment Health Serv Res 44:558-571, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-016-0738-1 , 2017), CACE was defined as the effect of intervention assignment for compliers, using two compliance cut points (50th and 75th percentile), on posttest ratings of student academic engagement, social competence, peer relations, emotion regulation, hyperactivity, and aggressive-disruptive behavior. The ITT analyses indicated improvements for students in the integrated condition on ratings of social competence compared to the control condition. The CACE analyses also indicated significant effects of the integrated intervention on social competence, as well as academic engagement and emotion regulation for students in high compliance classrooms. These findings illustrate the importance of considering variation in implementation within the context of RCTs.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32382359,Multiple Relapses of Visceral Leishmaniasis in HIV Co-Infected Patients: A Case Series from Ethiopia.,"Background:Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a life-threatening protozoan disease caused by parasites belonging to the Leishmania donovani complex. Ethiopia has the highest VL-HIV co-infection rate in the world, with several of these patients presenting with repeated episodes of VL disease (ie, relapse). However, we lack data on how HIV patients with multiple VL relapse present clinically, and whether they continue to respond to currently available medicines. Methods:The medical records of VL-HIV co-infected patients with multiple VL relapses at the Leishmaniasis Treatment and Research Center in Gondar, Ethiopia, between June 2012 and June 2016 were retrieved. Variables on their clinical and laboratory profiles were collected. Descriptive analysis was done to show the characteristics of the VL episodes. Result:A total of 48 VL episodes in 12 patients were identified, the median number of episodes per patient was 5 (interquartile range, 4-8 episodes). The median time to relapse was 5 months (interquartile range, 3-5.5 months). Splenomegaly was present in 47 of the episodes (98%), fever or other accompanying symptoms were present in only 66% (32 out of 48). The median tissue parasite grade at VL diagnosis was 6+ (interquartile range, 5+- 6+). All patients were on antiretroviral therapy. The median duration of treatment per episode was 2 months (interquartile range, 2-2 months). All patients achieved parasitological cure at discharge at each episode. Conclusions:Multiple recurrences of VL diseases were observed in HIV co-infected patients. With recurrent episodes, splenomegaly was found to be the main manifestation, whereas fever was less common. These patients came with recurrence of diseases in <6 months and required prolonged treatment to achieve cure.Further research on prediction, prevention, and better management options for recurrent VL is needed.

32391909,Global ocean resistome revealed: Exploring antibiotic resistance gene abundance and distribution in TARA Oceans samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>The rise of antibiotic resistance (AR) in clinical settings is of great concern. Therefore, the understanding of AR mechanisms, evolution, and global distribution is a priority for patient survival. Despite all efforts in the elucidation of AR mechanisms in clinical strains, little is known about its prevalence and evolution in environmental microorganisms. We used 293 metagenomic samples from the TARA Oceans project to detect and quantify environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using machine learning tools.<h4>Results</h4>After manual curation of ARGs, their abundance and distribution in the global ocean are presented. Additionally, the potential of horizontal ARG transfer by plasmids and their correlation with environmental and geographical parameters is shown. A total of 99,205 environmental open reading frames (ORFs) were classified as 1 of 560 different ARGs conferring resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. We found 24,567 ORFs in putative plasmid sequences, suggesting the importance of mobile genetic elements in the dynamics of environmental ARG transmission. Moreover, 4,804 contigs with >=2 putative ARGs were found, including 2 plasmid-like contigs with 5 different ARGs, highlighting the potential presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in the natural ocean environment. Finally, we identified ARGs conferring resistance to some of the most relevant clinical antibiotics, revealing the presence of 15 ARGs similar to mobilized colistin resistance genes (mcr) with high abundance on polar biomes. Of these, 5 are assigned to Psychrobacter, a genus including opportunistic human pathogens.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study uncovers the diversity and abundance of ARGs in the global ocean metagenome. Our results are available on Zenodo in MySQL database dump format, and all the code used for the analyses, including a Jupyter notebook js avaliable on Github. We also developed a dashboard web application (http://www.resistomedb.com) for data visualization.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced

32438827,Long-Term Exposure to Air Pollution and Incidence of Myocardial Infarction: A Danish Nurse Cohort Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Air pollution exposure has been linked to coronary heart disease, although evidence on PM2.5 and myocardial infarction (MI) incidence is mixed.<h4>Objectives</h4>This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate associations between long-term exposure to air pollution and MI incidence, adjusting for road traffic noise.<h4>Methods</h4>We used data from the nationwide Danish Nurse Cohort on 22,882 female nurses (>44 years of age) who, at recruitment in 1993 or 1999, reported information on cardiovascular disease risk factors. Data on MI incidence was collected from the Danish National Patient Register until the end of 2014. Annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with a diameter <2.5 �g/m3 (PM2.5), PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the nurses' residences since 1990 (PM10 and PM2.5) or 1970 (NO2 and NOx) were estimated using the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model/Urban Background Model/AirGIS (DEHM/UBM/AirGIS) dispersion model. We used time-varying Cox regression models to examine the association between 1- and 3-y running means of these pollutants, as well as 23-y running means of NO2 and NOx, with both overall and fatal incident MI. Associations were explored in three progressively adjusted models: Model 1, adjusted for age and baseline year; Model 2, with further adjustment for potential confounding by lifestyle and cardiovascular disease risk factors; and Model 3, with further adjustment for road traffic noise, modeled as the annual mean of a weighted 24-h average (Lden).<h4>Results</h4>Of the 22,882 women, 641 developed MI during a mean follow-up of 18.6 y, 121 (18.9%) of which were fatal. Reported hazard ratios (HRs) were based on interquartile range increases of 5.3, 5.5, 8.1, and 11.5 �g/m3 for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx, respectively. In Model 1, we observed a positive association between a 3-y running mean of PM2.5 and an overall incident MI with an HR= 1.20 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.35), which attenuated to HR= 1.06 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.23) in Model 2. In Model 1 for incident fatal MI, we observed a strong association with a 3-y running mean of PM2.5, with an HR= 1.69 (95% CI: 1.33, 2.13), which attenuated to HR= 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.81) in Model 2. Similar associations were seen for PM10, with 3-y, Model 2 estimates for overall and fatal incident MI of HR= 1.06 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.23) and HR= 1.35 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.81), respectively. No evidence of an association was observed for NO2 or NOx. For all pollutants, associations in Model 2 were robust to further adjustment for road traffic noise in Model 3 and were similar for a 1-y running mean exposure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We found no association between long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, or NOx and overall MI incidence, but we observed positive associations for PM2.5 and PM10 with fatal MI. We present novel findings that the association between PM and MI incidence is robust to adjustment for road traffic noise. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5818.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

32519765,A novel nonsense mutation of ZEB2 gene in a Chinese patient with Mowat-Wilson syndrome.,"<h4>Background</h4>Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and multiple anomalies caused by haploinsufficiency of�the ZEB2�gene. We investigated the genetic causes of MWS in a 14-year-old girl who had characteristic features of MWS.<h4>Methods</h4>Clinical data and peripheral blood DNA samples were collected from the proband. Following extraction of genomic DNA, whole-exome sequencing was conducted to detect genetic variants. Bioinformatics�analysis was�carried�out�to predict�the�function of the mutant gene.<h4>Results</h4>Mutation analysis of the proband identified a novel nonsense mutation (c.250G�>�T, p.E84*) within exon 3 of the�ZEB2�gene. This novel alteration resulted in a termination codon at amino acid position 84, which was predicted to encode a truncated protein. This variant was not present in unrelated healthy control samples that were obtained from the exome sequence databases ExAc browser (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) and gnomAD browser (http://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). It is a novel variant that was determined to be a deleterious mutation according to the variant interpretation guidelines of the ACMG. The results of our study suggest that the p.E84* mutation in the�ZEB2�gene was probably the pathogenic mutation that caused MWS in the proband.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study reports the novel mutation in the proband will provide a basic foundation for further investigations to elucidate the ZEB2-related mechanisms of MWS.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32541556,Interactive Web Application for Plotting Personalized Prognosis Prediction Curves in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Using Machine Learning.,"<h4>Background</h4>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative treatment option for malignant hematological disorders. Transplant clinicians estimate patient-specific prognosis empirically in clinical practice based on previous studies on similar patients. However, this approach does not provide objective data. The present study primarily aimed to develop a tool capable of providing accurate personalized prognosis prediction after allo-HCT in an objective manner.<h4>Methods</h4>We developed an interactive web application tool with a graphical user interface capable of plotting the personalized survival and cumulative incidence prediction curves after allo-HCT adjusted by 8 patient-specific factors, which are known as prognostic predictors, and assessed their predictive performances. A random survival forest model using the data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at our institution was applied to develop this application.<h4>Results</h4>We succeeded in showing the personalized prognosis prediction curves of 1-year overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse/progression, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) interactively using our web application (https://predicted-os-after-transplantation.shinyapps.io/RSF_model/). To assess its predictive performance, the entire cohort (363 cases) was split into a training cohort (70%) and a test cohort (30%) time-sequentially based on the patients' transplant dates. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for 1-year overall survival, progression-free survival, relapse/progression, and nonrelapse mortality in test cohort were 0.70, 0.72, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new web application could allow transplant clinicians to inform a new allo-HCT candidate of the objective personalized prognosis prediction and facilitate decision-making.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

We used a geographic information system analysis to estimate the annual average satellite-derived PM2.5 concentration for the geocoded location of the participants' baseline residences. Poor cognitive function was defined as a score of less than 18 on the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Competing risk models were performed to explore the association of PM2.5 with poor cognitive function.<h4>Results</h4>Each 10-�g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 5.1% increased risk of poor cognitive function [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.051; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.023, 1.079]. Compared to the lowest quartile of PM2.5 (<41.4 �g/m3), adjusted HR values were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.33), 1.27 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.41), and 1.21 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.34) for the second (=41.4-50.3 ug/m3), third (=50.3-60.7�g/m3), and fourth (=60.7 �g/m3) quartiles of PM2.5, respectively (<i>p</i> for trend <0.001). Subgroup analyses suggested stronger associations between PM2.5 and poor cognitive impairment in men than women. The association was positive in the 65- to 79- and =100-y age group but not significant and positive in the other two age groups with similar results.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PM2.5 was identified as a risk factor for poor cognitive function in Chinese older adults. Improving air quality may reduce the future population burden of poor cognitive function, especially in areas with high air pollution. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5304.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32611389,Proteus: An algorithm for proposing stabilizing mutation pairs based on interactions observed in known protein 3D structures.,"BACKGROUND:Protein engineering has many applications for industry, such as the development of new drugs, vaccines, treatment therapies, food, and biofuel production. A common way to engineer a protein is to perform mutations in functionally essential residues to optimize their function. However, the discovery of beneficial mutations for proteins is a complex task, with a time-consuming and high cost for experimental validation. Hence, computational approaches have been used to propose new insights for experiments narrowing the search space and reducing the costs. RESULTS:In this study, we developed Proteus (an acronym for Protein Engineering Supporter), a new algorithm for proposing mutation pairs in a target 3D structure. These suggestions are based on contacts observed in other known structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB). Proteus' basic assumption is that if a non-interacting pair of amino acid residues in the target structure is exchanged to an interacting pair, this could enhance protein stability. This trade is only allowed if the main-chain conformation of the residues involved in the contact is conserved. Furthermore, no steric impediment is expected between the proposed mutations and the surrounding protein atoms. To evaluate Proteus, we performed two case studies with proteins of industrial interests. In the first case study, we evaluated if the mutations suggested by Proteus for four protein structures enhance the number of inter-residue contacts. Our results suggest that most mutations proposed by Proteus increase the number of interactions into the protein. In the second case study, we used Proteus to suggest mutations for a lysozyme protein. Then, we compared Proteus' outcomes to mutations with available experimental evidence reported in the ProTherm database. Four mutations, in which our results agree with the experimental data, were found. This could be initial evidence that changes in the side-chain of some residues do not cause disturbances that harm protein structure stability. CONCLUSION:We believe that Proteus could be used combined with other methods to give new insights into the rational development of engineered proteins.

32626466,Application of data science in risk assessment and early warning.,"The food supply chain has been recognised by the EU as a critical infrastructure, and its complexity is the main cause of vulnerability. Depending on the food matrix, natural and/or deliberate contamination, food-borne diseases or even food fraud incidents may occur worldwide. Consequently, robust predictive models and/or software tools are needed to support decision-making and mitigating risks in an efficient and timely manner. In this frame, the fellow participated in data collection and analysis tasks, so as to provide additional predictive models. The working programme, covered a wide range of aspects related to risk assessment including identification of emerging risks (quantitative), microbiological risk assessment, authenticity assessment, spatio-temporal epidemiological modelling and database formation for hosting predictive microbial models.

32700975,Cytotoxicity Burst? Differentiating Specific from Nonspecific Effects in Tox21 <i>in Vitro</i> Reporter Gene Assays.,"<h4>Background</h4>High-throughput screening of chemicals with <i>in vitro</i> reporter gene assays in Tox21 has produced a large database on cytotoxicity and specific modes of action. However, the validity of some of the reported activities is questionable due to the """"cytotoxicity burst,"""" which refers to the supposition that many stress responses are activated in a nonspecific way at concentrations close to cell death.<h4>Objectives</h4>We propose a pragmatic method to identify whether reporter gene activation is specific or cytotoxicity-triggered by comparing the measured effects with baseline toxicity.<h4>Methods</h4>Baseline toxicity, also termed narcosis, is the minimal toxicity any chemical causes. Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) developed for baseline toxicity in mammalian reporter gene cell lines served as anchors to define the chemical-specific threshold for the cytotoxicity burst and to evaluate the degree of specificity of the reporter gene activation. Measured 10% effect concentrations were related to measured or QSAR-predicted 10% cytotoxicity concentrations yielding specificity ratios (SR). We applied this approach to our own experimental data and to ~8,000 chemicals that were tested in six of the high-throughput Tox21 reporter gene assays.<h4>Results</h4>Confirmed baseline toxicants activated reporter gene activity around cytotoxic concentrations triggered by the cytotoxicity burst. In six Tox21 assays, 37%-87% of the active hits were presumably caused by the cytotoxicity burst (SR<1) and only 2%-14% were specific with SR=10 against experimental cytotoxicity but 75%-97% were specific against baseline toxicity. This difference was caused by a large fraction of chemicals showing excess cytotoxicity.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The specificity analysis for measured <i>in vitro</i> effects identified whether a cytotoxicity burst had likely occurred. The SR-analysis not only prevented false positives, but it may also serve as measure for relative effect potency and can be used for quantitative <i>in vitro-in�vivo</i> extrapolation and risk assessment of chemicals. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6664.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32713858,PRIGSA2: Improved version of protein repeat identification by graph spectral analysis.,"Tandemly repeated structural motifs in proteins form highly stable structural folds and provide multiple binding sites associated with diverse functional roles. The tertiary structure and function of these proteins are determined by the type and copy number of the repeating units.

32750793,Index Networks.,"We show that existing upsampling operators can be unified using the notion of the index function. This notion is inspired by an observation in the decoding process of deep image matting where indices-guided unpooling can often recover boundary details considerably better than other upsampling operators such as bilinear interpolation. By viewing the indices as a function of the feature map, we introduce the concept of 'learning to index', and present a novel index-guided encoder-decoder framework where indices are learned adaptively from data and are used to guide downsampling and upsampling stages, without extra training supervision. At the core of this framework is a new learnable module, termed Index Network (IndexNet), which dynamically generates indices conditioned on the feature map. IndexNet can be used as a plug-in applicable to almost all convolutional networks that have coupled downsampling and upsampling stages, enabling the networks to dynamically capture variations of local patterns. In particular, we instantiate, investigate five families of IndexNet, highlight their superiority in delivering spatial information over other upsampling operators with experiments on synthetic data, and demonstrate their effectiveness on four dense prediction tasks, including image matting, image denoising, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

The prevalence of hypertension in Bangladesh has been increasing. However, there are very limited studies that have evaluated the impact of health education and awareness development in mitigating the burden of hypertension and its complications in Bangladesh. OBJECTIVE:This study aims to increase awareness, enhance knowledge, and change lifestyle behaviors through health education and the use of mobile health (mHealth) technology among individuals with hypertension living in a rural community of Bangladesh. METHODS:A randomized controlled trial is underway in a Mirzapur subdistrict of Bangladesh. This trial compares two groups of individuals with hypertension: The comparison arm receives health education and the intervention arm receives health education and a periodic mobile phone-based text message intervention. The trial duration is 5 months. The primary end point is participants' actual behavior changes brought about by increased awareness and knowledge. RESULTS:Enrollment of participants started in August 2018, and collection of follow-up data was completed at the end of July 2019. A total of 420 participants volunteered to participate, and among them, 209 and 211 were randomly allocated to the intervention group and the control group, respectively. Among them, the ratio of males/females was 12.0/88.0 in the intervention group and 16.1/83.9 in the control group. Data cleaning and analyses have been completed and the results have been submitted for publication. CONCLUSIONS:Periodic short education using mHealth technology in addition to face-to-face health education may be an effective method for increasing awareness and knowledge about behavioral changes and maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors.

32811511,Advancing brain barriers RNA sequencing: guidelines from experimental design to publication.,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in its varied forms has become an indispensable tool for analyzing differential gene expression and thus characterization of specific tissues. Aiming to understand the brain barriers genetic signature, RNA seq has also been introduced in brain barriers research. This has led to availability of both, bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq datasets over the last few years. If appropriately performed, the RNA-Seq studies provide powerful datasets that allow for significant deepening of knowledge on the molecular mechanisms that establish the brain barriers. However, RNA-Seq studies comprise complex workflows that require to consider many options and variables before, during and after the proper sequencing process.<h4>Main body</h4>In the current manuscript, we build on the interdisciplinary experience of the European PhD Training Network BtRAIN ( https://www.btrain-2020.eu/ ) where bioinformaticians and brain barriers researchers collaborated to analyze and establish RNA-Seq datasets on vertebrate brain barriers. The obstacles BtRAIN has identified in this process have been integrated into the present manuscript. It provides guidelines along the entire workflow of brain barriers RNA-Seq studies starting from the overall experimental design to interpretation of results. Focusing on the vertebrate endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) and epithelial blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier (BCSFB) of the choroid plexus, we provide a step-by-step description of the workflow, highlighting the decisions to be made at each step of the workflow and explaining the strengths and weaknesses of individual choices made. Finally, we propose recommendations for accurate data interpretation and on the information to be included into a publication to ensure appropriate accessibility of the data and reproducibility of the observations by the scientific community.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Next generation transcriptomic profiling of the brain barriers provides a novel resource for understanding the development, function and pathology of these barrier cells, which is essential for understanding CNS homeostasis and disease. Continuous advancement and sophistication of RNA-Seq will require interdisciplinary approaches between brain barrier researchers and bioinformaticians as successfully performed in BtRAIN. The present guidelines are built on the BtRAIN interdisciplinary experience and aim to facilitate collaboration of brain barriers researchers with bioinformaticians to advance RNA-Seq study design in the brain barriers community.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

32881514,Robust Accurate Identification and Biomass Estimates of Microorganisms via Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,"Rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms and estimation of their biomasses are of extreme importance to public health. Mass spectrometry has become an important technique for these purposes. Previously we published a workflow named <i>Mi</i>croorganism <i>C</i>lassification and <i>Id</i>entification (MiCId v.12.26.2017) that was shown to perform no worse than other workflows. This manuscript presents MiCId v.12.13.2018 that, in comparison with the earlier version v.12.26.2017, allows for biomass estimates, provides more accurate microorganism identifications (better controls the number of false positives), and is robust against database size increase. This significant advance is made possible by several new ingredients introduced: first, we apply a modified expectation-maximization method to compute for each taxon considered a prior probability, which can be used for biomass estimate; second, we introduce a new concept called ownership, through which the participation ratio is computed and use it as the number of taxa to be kept within a cluster of closely related taxa; third, based on confidently identified peptides, we calculate for each taxon its degree of independence from the rest of taxa considered to determine whether or not to split this taxon off the cluster. Using 270 data files, each containing a large number of MS/MS spectra, we show that, in comparison with v.12.26.2017, version v.12.13.2018 yields superior retrieval results. We also show that MiCId v.12.13.2018 can estimate species biomass reasonably well.

In the article http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pst0000288), the second to last sentence does not appear correctly and should appear instead as follows: The conclusion emerging from this study is that exploring better moments and building positivity efficiently counters depressive symptoms and builds well-being. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-12346-001.) In this qualitative study, we explored the experiences of clients receiving cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for major depressive disorder. All participants received 8 sessions of traditional CBT (based on Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emergy, 1979) and 8 sessions of positive CBT (order counterbalanced). The aim of the study was to examine clients' experience of positive CBT and to contrast this with their experience of traditional CBT. Positive CBT structurally and selectively focuses on better moments (exceptions to the problem as opposed to the problem), strengths, and positive emotions and integrates traditional CBT with solution-focused brief therapy and positive psychology. In addition to conducting interviews with 12 individuals, the second author attended all therapy sessions of 4 clients and observed biweekly supervision sessions as further methods of data collection. Qualitative analysis showed that, despite initial skepticism, clients preferred positive CBT and indicated experiencing a steeper learning curve during positive, compared with traditional, CBT for depression. The popularity of positive CBT was attributable to 4 influences: feeling good and empowered, benefitting from upward spiral effects of positive emotions, learning to appreciate baby steps, and (re)discovering optimism as a personal strength. Qualitative analysis showed that, despite better moments and building positivity efficiently counters depressive symptoms and builds well-being. Clients perceived positive CBT's upbeat tone as stimulating and as motivating for change. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32964354,A novel online calculator predicting short-term postoperative outcomes in patients with metastatic brain tumors.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Establishing predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS), discharge deposition, and total hospital charges is essential to providing high-quality, value-based care. Though previous research has investigated these outcomes for patients with metastatic brain tumors, there are currently no tools that synthesize such research findings and allow for prediction of these outcomes on a patient-by-patient basis. The present study sought to develop a prediction calculator that uses patient demographic and clinical information to predict extended hospital length of stay, non-routine discharge disposition, and high total hospital charges for patients with metastatic brain tumors.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients undergoing surgery for metastatic brain tumors at a single academic institution were analyzed (2017-2019). Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of extended LOS (> 7�days), non-routine discharge, and high total hospital charges (> $�46,082.63). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. C-statistics and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to assess model discrimination and calibration, respectively.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 235 patients were included in our analysis, with a mean age of 62.74�years. The majority of patients were female (52.3%) and Caucasian (76.6%). Our models predicting extended LOS, non-routine discharge, and high hospital charges had optimism-corrected c-statistics > 0.7, and all three models demonstrated adequate calibration (p > 0.05). The final models are available as an online calculator ( https://neurooncsurgery.shinyapps.io/brain_mets_calculator/ ).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our models predicting postoperative outcomes allow for individualized risk-estimation for patients following surgery for metastatic brain tumors. Our results may be useful in helping clinicians to provide resource-conscious, high-value care.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32978618,Deep learning based prediction of reversible HAT/HDAC-specific lysine acetylation.,"Protein lysine acetylation regulation is an important molecular mechanism for regulating cellular processes and plays critical physiological and pathological roles in cancers and diseases. Although massive acetylation sites have been identified through experimental identification and high-throughput proteomics techniques, their enzyme-specific regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we developed the deep learning-based protein lysine acetylation modification prediction (Deep-PLA) software for histone acetyltransferase (HAT)/histone deacetylase (HDAC)-specific acetylation prediction based on deep learning. Experimentally identified substrates and sites of several HATs and HDACs were curated from the literature to generate enzyme-specific data sets. We integrated various protein sequence features with deep neural network and optimized the hyperparameters with particle swarm optimization, which achieved satisfactory performance. Through comparisons based on cross-validations and testing data sets, the model outperformed previous studies. Meanwhile, we found that protein-protein interactions could enrich enzyme-specific acetylation regulatory relations and visualized this information in the Deep-PLA web server. Furthermore, a cross-cancer analysis of acetylation-associated mutations revealed that acetylation regulation was intensively disrupted by mutations in cancers and heavily implicated in the regulation of cancer signaling. These prediction and analysis results might provide helpful information to reveal the regulatory mechanism of protein acetylation in various biological processes to promote the research on prognosis and treatment of cancers. Therefore, the Deep-PLA predictor and protein acetylation interaction networks could provide helpful information for studying the regulation of protein acetylation.

The correct sentence should have read as follows: """"(b) direct assessments of strength of faith or positive impression management were not included or measured independently."""" All versions of this article have been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-54974-001.) The traditional background hypothesis (TBH) is a long-standing belief associated with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) L scale; a validity scale, which appears on every version of the family of MMPI instruments including the soon-to-be released MMPI-3. The L scale was originally designed to assess whether test respondents presented themselves in an unrealistically favorable light. Both researchers and clinicians noted, however, that those from traditional Christian faith-based groups produced elevated L-scale scores. A recent meta-analysis supported this observation, reporting an average L-scale elevation 0.50 SD greater than the MMPI-2 normative sample compared to samples of those with presumptively strong Christian-Judeo faith. Some limitations of this meta-analysis are that (a) the samples used in it included those undergoing an evaluative assessment, which could elevate L-scale scores independent of strength of faith belief, and (b) direct assessments of strength of faith or positive impression management were included or measured independently. Our primary goal in this study was to examine the TBH addressing these limitations with a sample of those who self-identified as believers in the Muslim faith (N = 267), the examination of which expands the scope beyond those of the Christian-Judeo faith. Consistent with previous results, the mean L-r (MMPI/MMPI-2 L scale counterpart on the MMPI-2-Restructured Form) was 56.41 T. Higher L-r scale scores were associated with increasing strength in the Muslim faith, and although increasing L-r scores were primarily associated with impression management, increasing Muslim-based faith values had a nontrivial influence on L-r scores and especially in the moderate score range of this scale.

33042605,LibMI: An Open Source Library for Efficient Histopathological Image Processing.,"<h4>Background</h4>Whole-slide images (WSIs) as a kind of image data are rapidly growing in the digital pathology domain. With unusual high resolution, these images make them hard to be supported by conventional tools or file formats. Thus, it obstructs data sharing and automated analysis. Here, we propose a library, LibMI, along with its open and standardized image file format. They can be used together to efficiently read, write, modify, and annotate large images.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>LibMI utilizes the concept of pyramid image structure and lazy propagation from a segment tree algorithm to support reading and modifying and to guarantee that both operations have linear time complexity. Further, a cache mechanism was introduced to speed up the program.<h4>Results</h4>LibMI is an open and efficient library for histopathological image processing. To demonstrate its functions, we applied it to several tasks including image thresholding, microscopic color correction, and storing pixel-wise information on WSIs. The result shows that libMI is particularly suitable for modifying large images. Furthermore, compared with congeneric libraries and file formats, libMI and modifiable multiscale image (MMSI) run 18.237 times faster on read-only tasks.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The combination of libMI library and MMSI file format enables developers to efficiently read and modify WSIs, thus can assist in pixel-wise image processing on extremely large images to promote building image processing pipeline.

33130899,Functional analysis of low-grade glioma genetic variants predicts key target genes and transcription factors.,"<h4>Background</h4>Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated thousands of germline genetic variants in modulating individuals' risk to various diseases, including cancer. At least 25 risk loci have been identified for low-grade gliomas (LGGs), but their molecular functions remain largely unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>We hypothesized that GWAS loci contain causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reside in accessible open chromatin regions and modulate the expression of target genes by perturbing the binding affinity of transcription factors (TFs). We performed an integrative analysis of genomic and epigenomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other public repositories to identify candidate causal SNPs within linkage disequilibrium blocks of LGG GWAS loci. We assessed their potential regulatory role via in silico TF binding sequence perturbations, convolutional neural network trained on TF binding data, and simulated annealing-based interpretation methods.<h4>Results</h4>We built an interactive website (http://education.knoweng.org/alg3/) summarizing the functional footprinting of 280 variants in 25 LGG GWAS regions, providing rich information for further computational and experimental scrutiny. We identified as case studies PHLDB1 and SLC25A26 as candidate target genes of rs12803321 and rs11706832, respectively, and predicted the GWAS variant rs648044 to be the causal SNP modulating ZBTB16, a known tumor suppressor in multiple cancers. We showed that rs648044 likely perturbed the binding affinity of the TF MAFF, as supported by RNA interference and in vitro MAFF binding experiments.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The identified candidate (causal SNP, target gene, TF) triplets and the accompanying resource will help accelerate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic risk factors for gliomas.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Physical impairment was measured using the Physical Component Summary (PCS) score of the Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) three-component model (using Japanese norms). Older T2DM patients (=65 years old; <i>n</i> = 1511) were dichotomized into physically impaired (PCS = 25th percentile; <i>n</i> = 378) and non-physically impaired (PCS > 25th percentile; <i>n</i> = 1133). Work productivity (absenteeism, presenteeism and overall work impairment), activity impairment and healthcare resource utilization were compared between these groups.<h4>Results</h4>Age, female sex, low and high body mass index (BMI), diabetes-related complications, cardiovascular events, unawareness of having hypoglycemic events in the past 3 months, and lack of regular exercise were significant factors associated with physical impairment in multivariable analysis. The physically impaired group reported significantly more regular outpatient visits (13.48 vs. 10.16, respectively, <i>p</i> < .001), 1% or greater absenteeism (16.7% vs. 4.1%, <i>p</i> = .005), greater presenteeism (27.8% vs. 12.2%, <i>p</i> = .001), overall work impairment (30.0% vs. 13.0%, <i>p</i> = .001) and overall activity impairment (39.5% vs. 17.2%, <i>p <</i> .001) than the non-physically-impaired group after adjusting for covariates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study identified age, BMI, diabetes-related comorbidities, history of cardiovascular events and lack of exercise as key predictors associated with physical impairment in older patients with T2DM in Japan, which predicted low work productivity as well as activity impairment. This study provides support that physical impairment in patients with T2DM may lead to low work productivity and activity impairment.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2020.1846170.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33186370,Individual and community level factors associated with anemia among children 6-59 months of age in Ethiopia: A further analysis of 2016 Ethiopia demographic and health survey.,"<h4>Background</h4>Anemia is a global public health problem; but its burden is disproportionately borne among children in the African Regions. The 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey report showed that the prevalence of anemia among children 6-59 months of age was 57%; far exceeding the national target of 25% set for 2015. Although studies have been conducted in Ethiopia, multilevel analysis has rarely been used to identify factors associated with anemia among children. Therefore, this study aimed to identify individual and community-level factors associated with anemia among children 6-59 months of age by fitting a multilevel logistic regression model.<h4>Methods</h4>The data was obtained from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, conducted from January to June 2016, and downloaded from the website http://www.DHSprogram.com. The sample was taken using two-stage stratified sampling. In stage one, 645 Enumeration Areas and in stage two 28 households per Enumeration Area were selected. A sample of 7790 children 6-59 months of age was included. Data were analyzed using STATA version 14. A multilevel logistic regression model was fitted and an adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was obtained.<h4>Result</h4>From the individual-level factors, anemia was associated most strongly with child age, wealth index, maternal anemia and child stunting followed by child underweight, child fever and birth order whereas from the community-level, the strongest odds of anemia occurred among children from Somali, Harari, Dire Dawa and Afar region followed by Oromia and Addis Ababa. Low community-poverty is a protective factor for anemia. The odds of anemia were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99) times lower for children who were living in communities of lower poverty status than children who were living in communities of higher poverty status. Children from Somali and Dire Dawa had 3.38 (95% CI: 3.25, 5.07) and 2.22 (95% CI: 1.42, 3.48) times higher odds of anemia, respectively than children from the Tigray region.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study shows that anemia among children 6-59 months of age is affected both by the individual and community level factors. It is better to strengthen the strategies of early detection and management of stunted and underweight children. At the same time, interventions should be strengthened to address maternal anemia, child fever and poverty, specifically targeting regions identified to have a high risk of anemia.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33244798,Comparing the motivational value of rewards and losses in an EEG-pupillometry study.,"We found earlier that performance-contingent rewards lead to faster performance than equivalent losses [Carsten, Hoofs, Boehler, & Krebs, 2019. Motivation Science, 5(3). http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/mot0000117]. Here, we further tested the hypothesis that motivation to gain rewards is higher than to avoid losses, even when incentive values are matched. As implicit markers of motivation, we assessed electroencephalography (EEG) focusing on the P3 after target and feedback onset, and the Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN), as well as simultaneously recorded pupil size. Comparing only reward and loss prospect trials in Experiment 1, we found no consistent differences in behavior and electrophysiological markers of motivation, although pupil data suggested higher arousal after feedback in potential-loss trials. Including additional no-incentive trials in Experiment 2, we found consistent evidence that motivation to gain rewards was higher than to avoid losses: In line with behavior, the target-P3 was most pronounced for reward-related stimuli, followed by loss and no-incentive ones. This same ranking was found in the P3 and the FRN after positive outcomes (i.e., reward, avoided loss, and correct feedback in no-incentive trials). Negative outcomes featured a different pattern in line with the pupil response, which suggests that losses are emotionally salient events, without invigorating behavior proportionally. In sum, these findings suggest that the motivation to gain rewards is more pronounced than motivation to avoid equivalent losses, at least in tasks promoting transient increases in attention triggered by incentive prospect. These motivational differences may arise as avoided losses are not profitable in the long term, in contrast to gained rewards.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33245691,NonClasGP-Pred: robust and efficient prediction of non-classically secreted proteins by integrating subset-specific optimal models of imbalanced data.,"Non-classically secreted proteins (NCSPs) are proteins that are located in the extracellular environment, although there is a lack of known signal peptides or secretion motifs. They usually perform different biological functions in intracellular and extracellular environments, and several of their biological functions are linked to bacterial virulence and cell defence. Accurate protein localization is essential for all living organisms, however, the performance of existing methods developed for NCSP identification has been unsatisfactory and in particular suffer from data deficiency and possible overfitting problems. Further improvement is desirable, especially to address the lack of informative features and mining subset-specific features in imbalanced datasets. In the present study, a new computational predictor was developed for NCSP prediction of gram-positive bacteria. First, to address the possible prediction bias caused by the data imbalance problem, ten balanced subdatasets were generated for ensemble model construction. Then, the F-score algorithm combined with sequential forward search was used to strengthen the feature representation ability for each of the training subdatasets. Third, the subset-specific optimal feature combination process was adopted to characterize the original data from different aspects, and all subdataset-based models were integrated into a unified model, NonClasGP-Pred, which achieved an excellent performance with an accuracy of 93.23 %, a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 89.01 %, a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 87.68 % and an area under the curve value of 0.9975 for ten-fold cross-validation.

33295759,Skin Doctor CP: Conformal Prediction of the Skin Sensitization Potential of Small Organic Molecules.,"Skin sensitization potential or potency is an important end point in the safety assessment of new chemicals and new chemical mixtures. Formerly, animal experiments such as the local lymph node assay (LLNA) were the main form of assessment. Today, however, the focus lies on the development of nonanimal testing approaches (i.e., in vitro and in chemico assays) and computational models. In this work, we investigate, based on publicly available LLNA data, the ability of aggregated, Mondrian conformal prediction classifiers to differentiate between non- sensitizing and sensitizing compounds as well as between two levels of skin sensitization potential (weak to moderate sensitizers, and strong to extreme sensitizers). The advantage of the conformal prediction framework over other modeling approaches is that it assigns compounds to activity classes only if a defined minimum level of confidence is reached for the individual predictions. This eliminates the need for applicability domain criteria that often are arbitrary in their nature and less flexible. Our new binary classifier, named Skin Doctor CP, differentiates nonsensitizers from sensitizers with a higher reliability-to-efficiency ratio than the corresponding nonconformal prediction workflow that we presented earlier. When tested on a set of 257 compounds at the significance levels of 0.10 and 0.30, the model reached an efficiency of 0.49 and 0.92, and an accuracy of 0.83 and 0.75, respectively. In addition, we developed a ternary classification workflow to differentiate nonsensitizers, weak to moderate sensitizers, and strong to extreme sensitizers. Although this model achieved satisfactory overall performance (accuracies of 0.90 and 0.73, and efficiencies of 0.42 and 0.90, at significance levels 0.10 and 0.30, respectively), it did not obtain satisfying class-wise results (at a significance level of 0.30, the validities obtained for nonsensitizers, weak to moderate sensitizers, and strong to extreme sensitizers were 0.70, 0.58, and 0.63, respectively). We argue that the model is, in consequence, unable to reliably identify strong to extreme sensitizers and suggest that other ternary models derived from the currently accessible LLNA data might suffer from the same problem.

However, traditional identification methods are extremely time-consuming and can not obtain an accurate result. In this paper, we proposed a predictor called iDHS-DASTS to identify the DHS based on benchmark datasets. First, we adopt a feature extraction method called PseDNC which can incorporate the original DNA properties and spatial information of the DNA sequence. Then we use a method called LASSO to reduce the dimensions of the original data. Finally, we utilize stacking learning as a classifier, which includes Adaboost, random forest, gradient boosting, extra trees and SVM. Before we train the classifier, we use SMOTE-Tomek to overcome the imbalance of the datasets. In the experiment, our iDHS-DASTS achieves remarkable performance on three benchmark datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results with over 92.06%, 91.06% and 90.72% accuracy for datasets [Doublestruck S]1, [Doublestruck S]2 and [Doublestruck S]3, respectively. To verify the validation and transferability of our model, we establish another independent dataset [Doublestruck S]4, for which the accuracy can reach 90.31%.

Although neuromodulation has a role in the treatment of cancer pain for some patients, these therapies may not be suitable for all patients. Therefore, neuroablative procedures, which were once a mainstay in treating intractable cancer pain, are again on the rise. This guideline serves as a systematic review of the literature of the outcomes following neuroablative procedures.<h4>Objective</h4>To establish clinical practice guidelines for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review of neuroablative procedures used to treat patients with cancer pain from 1980 to April 2019 was performed using the United States National Library of Medicine PubMed database, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL. After inclusion criteria were established, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed by 2 members of the task force and the quality of the evidence was graded.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 14 646 relevant abstracts were identified by the literature search, from which 189 met initial screening criteria. After full text review, 58 of the 189 articles were included and subdivided into 4 different clinical scenarios. These include unilateral somatic nociceptive/neuropathic body cancer pain, craniofacial cancer pain, midline subdiaphragmatic visceral cancer pain, and disseminated cancer pain. Class II and III evidence was available for these 4 clinical scenarios. Level III recommendations were developed for the use of neuroablative procedures to treat patients with cancer pain.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neuroablative procedures may be an option for treating patients with refractory cancer pain. Serious adverse events were reported in some studies, but were relatively uncommon. Improved imaging, refinements in technique and the availability of new lesioning modalities may minimize the risks of neuroablation even further.The full guidelines can be accessed at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/browse-guidelines-detail/guidelines-on-neuroablative-procedures-patients-wi.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

However, gene finding involves tremendous cost, time and effort. To alleviate these problems, research on utilizing computational biology to decrease the search space of candidate genes is actively conducted.In this study, we propose a framework in which diseases, genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are represented by a layered network, and key genes are predicted by a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm utilizes a network-based semi-supervised learning model that can be applied to layered data structures.<h4>Results</h4>The proposed method was applied to a dataset extracted from public databases related to diseases and genes with data collected from 186 patients. A portion of key genes obtained using the proposed method was verified in silico through PubMed literature, and the remaining genes were left as possible candidate genes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The code for the framework will be available at http://www.alphaminers.net/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33402389,Hypoxia-Induced Suppression of Alternative Splicing of MBD2 Promotes Breast Cancer Metastasis via Activation of FZD1.,"Metastasis is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths, however, the mechanisms underlying metastasis in this disease remain largely elusive. Here we report that under hypoxic conditions, alternative splicing of MBD2 is suppressed, favoring the production of MBD2a, which facilitates breast cancer metastasis. Specifically, MBD2a promoted, whereas its lesser known short form MBD2c suppressed metastasis. Activation of HIF1 under hypoxia facilitated MBD2a production via repression of SRSF2-mediated alternative splicing. As a result, elevated MBD2a outcompeted MBD2c for binding to promoter CpG islands to activate expression of FZD1, thereby promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastasis. Strikingly, clinical data reveal significantly correlated expression of MBD2a and MBD2c with the invasiveness of malignancy, indicating opposing roles for MBD2 splicing variants in regulating human breast cancer metastasis. Collectively, our findings establish a novel link between MBD2 switching and tumor metastasis and provide a promising therapeutic strategy and predictive biomarkers for hypoxia-driven breast cancer metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: This study defines the opposing roles and clinical relevance of MBD2a and MBD2c, two MBD2 alternative splicing products, in hypoxia-driven breast cancer metastasis.

33457124,GAPDH and PUM1: Optimal Housekeeping Genes for Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction-Based Analysis of Cancer Stem Cells and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Gene Expression in Rectal Tumors.,"Background The overwhelming majority of published articles have taken colon and rectal cancer as a single group, i.e., colorectal cancer, when normalizing gene expression data with housekeeping genes (HKG) in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments though there are published reports that suggest the differential expression pattern of genes between the colon and rectal cancer groups and hence the current experiment was�attempted to find out the optimal set of�housekeeping genes from the list of common HKG for rectal tumor gene expression analysis. Methods The expression of five�potential housekeeping genes GAPDH, RPNI, PUM1, B2M, and PMM1�was analyzed through qPCR and Bestkeeper software (http://www.wzw.tum.de/gene-quantification/bestkeeper.html) in 20 stage II-IV rectal cancer samples�to check for uniformity in their expression pattern. Cancer stem cell (CSC) marker ALDH1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition marker (EMT) markers E cadherin, vimentin, Twist,�and SNAI2 expression were evaluated in conjunction with the two optimal reference genes in�10 rectal cancers as part of validation. Results The standard deviation of the cycle threshold value of GAPDH was found the lowest at 0.65 followed by RPN1 at 0.88, PUM1 at 0.94, PMM1 at 0.94, and B2M at 1.21 when analyzed with BestKeeper software. Using GAPDH and PUM1 as the reference gene for the validation phase, rectal cancer patients with stage�III/IV showed a 4.79-fold change (P=0.006) in ALDH1 expression, and an 11.76-fold change in Twist expression (P=0.003) with respect to stage II rectal tumor when normalized with GAPDH and PUM1. Conclusion GAPDH and PUM1 can be used as an optimal set of housekeeping genes for gene expression-related experiments in rectal tumors. ALDH1 and Twist were found significantly overexpressed in stage III/IV rectal tumors in comparison to stage II rectal cancer. Genes associated with�cancer stem cells and EMT markers could be optimally analyzed by normalizing them with GAPDH and PUM1 as housekeeping genes.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33483306,Locus of Heat Resistance (LHR) in Meat-Borne Escherichia coli: Screening and Genetic Characterization.,"Microbial resistance to processing treatments poses a food safety concern, as treatment tolerant pathogens can emerge. Occasional foodborne outbreaks caused by pathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> have led to human and economic losses. Therefore, this study screened for the extreme heat resistance (XHR) phenotype as well as one known genetic marker, the locus of heat resistance (LHR), in 4,123 <i>E. coli</i> isolates from diverse meat animals at different processing stages. The prevalences of XHR and LHR among the meat-borne <i>E. coli</i> were found to be 10.3% and 11.4%, respectively, with 19% agreement between the two. Finished meat products showed the highest LHR prevalence (24.3%) compared to other processing stages (0 to 0.6%). None of the LHR<sup>+</sup> <i>E. coli</i> in this study would be considered pathogens based on screening for virulence genes. Four high-quality genomes were generated by whole-genome sequencing of representative LHR<sup>+</sup> isolates. Nine horizontally acquired LHRs were identified and characterized, four plasmid-borne and five chromosomal. Nine newly identified LHRs belong to ClpK1 LHR or ClpK2 LHR variants sharing 61 to 68% nucleotide sequence identity, while one LHR appears to be a hybrid. Our observations suggest positive correlation between the number of LHR regions present in isolates and the extent of heat resistance. The isolate exhibiting the highest degree of heat resistance possessed four LHRs belonging to three different variant groups. Maintenance of as many as four LHRs in a single genome emphasizes the benefits of the LHR in bacterial physiology and stress response.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Currently, a """"multiple-hurdle"""" approach based on a combination of different antimicrobial interventions, including heat, is being utilized during meat processing to control the burden of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. Our recent study (M. Guragain, G. E. Smith, D. A. King, and J. M. Bosilevac, J Food Prot 83:1438-1443, 2020, https://doi.org/10.4315/JFP-20-103) suggests that U.S. beef cattle harbor <i>Escherichia coli</i> that possess the locus of heat resistance (LHR). LHR seemingly contributes to the global stress tolerance in bacteria and hence poses a food safety concern. Therefore, it is important to understand the distribution of the LHRs among meat-borne bacteria identified at different stages of different meat processing systems. Complete genome sequencing and comparative analysis of selected heat-resistant bacteria provide a clearer understanding of stress and heat resistance mechanisms. Further, sequencing data may offer a platform to gain further insights into the genetic background that provides optimal bacterial tolerance against heat and other processing treatments.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33533177,Neuroblastoma: The basis for cure in limited-resource settings.,"<h4>Background</h4>Neuroblastoma (NB) contributes the most to the mortality of childhood malignancies worldwide. The disease spectrum is heterogenous and the management complex and costly, especially in advanced disease or disease with adverse biology. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the majority of NB presents in advanced stages. Therefore, with limited resources and poor prognosis the treatment of NB is often not a priority. The aim of the study was to evaluate the research activities and perceptions of the management of NB that determine the research and treatment approaches in LMICs.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were sourced from https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ identifying NB trials open to LMIC. Abstracts on NB research presented at the International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) Congresses between 2014 and 2020 were evaluated according to income status. An online survey evaluating medical views on NB in LMICs and the effect on the management was conducted. Descriptive analysis was done. Where appropriate categorical association between covariates was assessed using the Pearson chi-square (<U+03C7><sup>2</sup> ) test or Fishers exact test.<h4>Results</h4>There were 15/562 (2.7%) trials open to LMIC. Only six of 138 (4.3%) LMIC participated in NB trials. Of the 688 abstracts presented between 2014 and 2020 at the SIOP International Congress on NB as primary subject, 297 (42.7%) were from LMICs. Only two were from low-income countries (LICs). Sixty-one countries responded to the NB survey. Positive views towards NB management were present when treatment was based on a national protocol, the availability of trimodal or advanced treatment options were present, and when a balance of metastatic or local disease were treated.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Management of NB in LMICs should include increased advocacy and research as well as implementation of national management strategies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33544274,The Characterization of Sex Differences in Hypoglycemia-Induced Activation of HPA Axis on the Transcriptomic Level.,"Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis using an insulin tolerance test (ITT) is a medical diagnostic procedure that is frequently used in humans to assess the HPA and growth-hormone (GH) axes. Whether sex differences exist in the response to ITT stress is unknown. Thus, investigations into the analysis of transcripts during activation of the HPA axis in response to hypoglycemia have revealed the underlying influences of sex in signaling pathways that stimulate the HPA axis. We assessed four time points of ITT application in Balb/c mice. After insulin injection, expression levels of 192 microRNAs and 41 mRNAs associated with the HPA, GH�and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes were determined by real-time RT-PCR in the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal tissues, as well as blood samples (Raw data accession: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qI00NAtjxOepcNKxSJnQbJeBFa6zgHK?usp=sharing ). Although the ITT is commonly used as a gold standard for evaluating the HPA axis, we found completely different responses between males and females with respect to activation of the HPA axis. While activation of several transcripts in the hypothalamus and pituitary was observed after performing the ITT in males within 10�min, females responded via the pituitary and adrenal immediately and durably over 40�min. Additionally, we found that microRNA alterations precede mRNA responses in the HPA axis. Furthermore, robust changes in the levels of several transcripts including Avpr1b and Avpr2 observed at all time points strongly suggest that transcriptional control of these genes occurs mostly via differential signaling in pituitary and blood between males and females. Male and female HPA axis responses to ITT involve a number of sophisticated regulatory signaling pathways of miRNAs and mRNAs. Our results highlight the first robust markers in several layers of HPA, HPG and GH axis involved in ITT/hypoglycemia stress-induced dynamics.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

33587706,StructADMM: Achieving Ultrahigh Efficiency in Structured Pruning for DNNs.,"Weight pruning methods of deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to achieve a good model pruning rate without loss of accuracy, thereby alleviating the significant computation/storage requirements of large-scale DNNs. Structured weight pruning methods have been proposed to overcome the limitation of irregular network structure and demonstrated actual GPU acceleration. However, in prior work, the pruning rate (degree of sparsity) and GPU acceleration are limited (to less than 50%) when accuracy needs to be maintained. In this work, we overcome these limitations by proposing a unified, systematic framework of structured weight pruning for DNNs. It is a framework that can be used to induce different types of structured sparsity, such as filterwise, channelwise, and shapewise sparsity, as well as nonstructured sparsity. The proposed framework incorporates stochastic gradient descent (SGD; or ADAM) with alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and can be understood as a dynamic regularization method in which the regularization target is analytically updated in each iteration. Leveraging special characteristics of ADMM, we further propose a progressive, multistep weight pruning framework and a network purification and unused path removal procedure, in order to achieve higher pruning rate without accuracy loss. Without loss of accuracy on the AlexNet model, we achieve 2.58x and 3.65x average measured speedup on two GPUs, clearly outperforming the prior work. The average speedups reach 3.15x and 8.52x when allowing a moderate accuracy loss of 2%. In this case, the model compression for convolutional layers is 15.0x, corresponding to 11.93x measured CPU speedup. As another example, for the ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 data set, we achieve an unprecedented 54.2x structured pruning rate on CONV layers. This is 32x higher pruning rate compared with recent work and can further translate into 7.6x inference time speedup on the Adreno 640 mobile GPU compared with the original, unpruned DNN model.

33621129,Associations between Blood Lead Levels and Coronary Artery Stenosis Measured Using Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lead exposure is a risk factor for increased blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, even when blood lead levels (BLLs) are within the normal range.<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to investigate the association between BLL and coronary artery stenosis (CAS) in asymptomatic adults using 128-slice dual-source coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed medical records data from 2,193 adults (1,461 men and 732 women) who elected to complete a screening health examination, coronary CT angiography, and BLL measurement during 2011-2018 and had no history of CAS symptoms, cardiovascular disease, or occupational exposure to lead. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between moderate-to-severe CAS (=25% stenosis) and a 1-�g/dL increase in blood lead, with and without adjustment for age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, body mass index, regular exercise, smoking status, and alcohol drinking.<h4>Results</h4>BLLs ranged from 0.12 to 10.14�g/dL, with an arithmetic mean of 2.71�1.26�g/dL. The arithmetic mean was higher for men than for women (2.98�1.26�g/dL vs. 2.18�1.08�g/dL, p<0.001) and higher in the moderate-to-severe CAS group than in the no-CAS or <25% stenosis group (3.02�1.44�g/dL vs. 2.67�1.23�g/dL, p<0.001). Moderate-to-severe CAS was significantly associated with BLL before and after adjustment, with an adjusted odds ratio for a 1-�g/dL increase in BLL of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.26), p=0.017.<h4>Conclusions</h4>BLL was positively associated with the prevalence of moderate-to-severe CAS in Korean adults who completed an elective screening examination for early cardiovascular disease, 94% of whom had a BLL of <5�g/dL. More efforts and a strict health policy are needed to further reduce BLLs in the general population. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7351.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33675341,Maternal BMI is positively associated with human milk fat: a systematic review and meta-regression analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Lack of robust estimates of human-milk nutrient composition and influential maternal factors, such as body composition, are barriers to informing nutrition policies and programs.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective was to understand the relation between maternal BMI and human-milk energy, fat, and/or total protein.<h4>Methods</h4>Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science) were searched. Outcomes assessed were human-milk energy (kcal/L), fat (g/L), and total protein (g/L) from mothers 1 to 6 mo postpartum. Studies with data on maternal BMI or weight and height that quantified human-milk energy, fat, or protein between 1 and 6 mo postpartum were eligible. Random-effects meta-regression weighted by the inverse of the study-level SE was completed for each of the 3 outcomes. The certainty of evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 11,373 titles and abstracts were identified, and after full-text screening, 69 articles of 66 studies were included. Meta-regression results showed a positive association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat (�: 0.56 g/L; 95% CI: 0.034, 1.1; P = 0.04; I2 = 93.7%, n = 63 datapoints). There was no significant association between maternal BMI and human-milk energy (�: 3.9 kcal/L; 95% CI: -1.6, 9.5; P = 0.16, I2 = 93.3%, n = 40 datapoints) or total protein (�: 0.13 g/L; 95% CI: -0.16, 0.41; P = 0.37, I2 = 99.1%, n = 40 datapoints). The certainty of evidence for human-milk energy was low and the certainty of evidence for fat and total protein was very low.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Meta-regression analysis of available literature suggested an association between maternal BMI and human-milk fat between 1 and 6 mo postpartum. Future studies are needed to confirm the relation between maternal BMI; variation in human-milk energy, fat, and protein content; and the implications for child growth and development.

High mortality is associated with patients developing cytokine storm syndrome. Treatment of hyper-inflammation in these patients using existing, approved therapies with proven safety profiles could address the immediate need to reduce mortality.<h4>Results</h4>We analyzed the changes in the gene expression, pathways and putative mechanisms induced by SARS-CoV2 in NHBE, and A549 cells, as well as COVID-19 lung vs. their respective controls. We used these changes to identify FDA approved drugs that could be repurposed to help COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms related to hyper-inflammation. We identified methylprednisolone (MP) as a potential leading therapy. The results were then confirmed in five independent validation data sets including Vero E6 cells, lung and intestinal organoids, as well as additional patient lung sample vs. their respective controls. Finally, the efficacy of MP was validated in an independent clinical study. Thirty-day all-cause mortality occurred at a significantly lower rate in the MP-treated group compared to control group (29.6% vs. 16.6%, p = 0.027). Clinical results confirmed the in silico prediction that MP could improve outcomes in severe cases of COVID-19. A low number needed to treat (NNT = 5) suggests MP may be more efficacious than dexamethasone or hydrocortisone.<h4>Availability</h4>iPathwayGuide is available at https://ipathwayguide.advaitabio.com/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33720349,"Robust, flexible, and scalable tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium across diverse ancestries.","Traditional Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) tests (the <U+03C7>2 test and the exact test) have long been used as a metric for evaluating genotype quality, as technical artifacts leading to incorrect genotype calls often can be identified as deviations from HWE. However, in data sets composed of individuals from diverse ancestries, HWE can be violated even without genotyping error, complicating the use of HWE testing to assess genotype data quality. In this manuscript, we present the Robust Unified Test for HWE (RUTH) to test for HWE while accounting for population structure and genotype uncertainty, and to evaluate the impact of population heterogeneity and genotype uncertainty on the standard HWE tests and alternative methods using simulated and real sequence data sets. Our results demonstrate that ignoring population structure or genotype uncertainty in HWE tests can inflate false-positive rates by many orders of magnitude. Our evaluations demonstrate different tradeoffs between false positives and statistical power across the methods, with RUTH consistently among the best across all evaluations. RUTH is implemented as a practical and scalable software tool to rapidly perform HWE tests across millions of markers and hundreds of thousands of individuals while supporting standard VCF/BCF formats.

33725111,Whole genome analysis of more than 10 000 SARS-CoV-2 virus unveils global genetic diversity and target region of NSP6.,"Whole genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 is important to identify its genetic diversity. Moreover, accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 is required for its correct diagnosis. To address these, first we have analysed publicly available 10 664 complete or near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of 73 countries globally to find mutation points in the coding regions as substitution, deletion, insertion and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) globally and country wise. In this regard, multiple sequence alignment is performed in the presence of reference sequence from NCBI. Once the alignment is done, a consensus sequence is build to analyse each genomic sequence to identify the unique mutation points as substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs globally, thereby resulting in 7209, 11700, 119 and 53 such mutation points respectively. Second, in such categories, unique mutations for individual countries are determined with respect to other 72 countries. In case of India, unique 385, 867, 1 and 11 substitutions, deletions, insertions and SNPs are present in 566 SARS-CoV-2 genomes while 458, 1343, 8 and 52 mutation points in such categories are common with other countries. In majority (above 10%) of virus population, the most frequent and common mutation points between global excluding India and India are L37F, P323L, F506L, S507G, D614G and Q57H in NSP6, RdRp, Exon, Spike and ORF3a respectively. While for India, the other most frequent mutation points are T1198K, A97V, T315N and P13L in NSP3, RdRp, Spike and ORF8 respectively. These mutations are further visualised in protein structures and phylogenetic analysis has been done to show the diversity in virus genomes. Third, a web application is provided for searching mutation points globally and country wise. Finally, we have identified the potential conserved region as target that belongs to the coding region of ORF1ab, specifically to the NSP6 gene. Subsequently, we have provided the primers and probes using that conserved region so that it can be used for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

33751898,Rate of Communicative Gestures and Developmental Outcomes in Toddlers With and Without Autism Spectrum Disorder During a Home Observation.,"Purpose Most toddlers with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental delays receive early intervention at home and may not participate in a clinic-based communication evaluation. However, there is limited research that has prospectively examined communication in very young children with and without autism in a home-based setting. This study used granular observational coding to document the communicative acts performed by toddlers with autism, developmental delay, and typical development in the home environment. Method Children were selected from the archival database of the FIRST WORDS Project (<i>N</i> = 211). At approximately 20 months of age, each child participated in everyday activities with a caregiver during an hour-long, video-recorded, naturalistic home observation. Inventories of unique gestures, rates per minute, and proportions of types of communicative acts and communicative functions were coded and compared using a one-way analysis of variance. Concurrent and prospective relationships between rate of communication and measures of social communication, language development, and autism symptoms were examined. Results A total of 40,738 communicative acts were coded. Children with autism, developmental delay, and typical development used eight, nine, and 12 unique gestures on average, respectively. Children with autism used deictic gestures, vocalizations, and communicative acts for behavior regulation at significantly lower rates than the other groups. Statistically significant correlations were observed between rate of communication and several outcome measures. Conclusion Observation of social communication in the natural environment may improve early identification of children with autism and communication delays, complement clinic-based assessments, and provide useful information about a child's social communication profile and the family's preferred activities and intervention priorities.

33761699,Increased bleeding events with the addition of apixaban to the dual anti-platelet regimen for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome: A meta-analysis.,"<h4>Background</h4>Dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel has been the mainstay of treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the recurrence of thrombotic events, potential aspirin and clopidogrel hypo-responsiveness, and other limitations of DAPT have led to the development of newer oral anti-thrombotic drugs. Apixaban, a new non-vitamin K antagonist, has been approved for use. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to compare the bleeding outcomes observed with the addition of apixaban to DAPT for the treatment of patients with ACS.<h4>Methods</h4>Online databases including EMBASE, Cochrane Central, http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched for English based publications comparing the use of apixaban added to DAPT for the treatment of patients with ACS. Different categories of bleeding events and cardiovascular outcomes were assessed. The analysis was carried out by the RevMan software version 5.4. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to represent the data following analysis.<h4>Results</h4>This research analysis consisted of 4 trials with a total number of 9010 participants. Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) defined major bleeding (OR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.45-4.12; P = .0008), TIMI defined minor bleeding (OR: 3.12, 95% CI: 1.71-5.70; P = .0002), International society of thrombosis and hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding (OR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.80-3.45; P = .00001) and Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Arteries (GUSTO) defined severe bleeding (OR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.56-5.78; P = .01) were significantly increased with the addition of apixaban to DAPT versus DAPT alone in these patients with ACS. However fatal bleeding (OR: 10.96, 95% CI: 0.61-198.3; P = .11) was not significantly different.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Addition of the novel oral anticoagulant apixaban to the DAPT regimen significantly increased bleeding and therefore did not show any beneficial effect in these patients with ACS. However, due to the extremely limited data, we apparently have to rely on future larger studies to confirm this hypothesis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The main outcome was DFS analysed through uni- and multivariable analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank testing, recursive partitioning analysis, and nomogram development.<h4>Results</h4>The median follow up was 62.3 (interquartile range [IQR] 38.1-79) months. The independent clinical factors associated with increased risk of recurrence or progression in the multivariate analysis (MVA) were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before RT, pT3 characteristic, and local failure as salvage indication. The value of PSA nadir had a significant impact on the risk of biochemical failure. Biochemical control and DFS were significantly different depending on treatment indication (p < 0.0001). The recursive partitioning analysis highlighted the importance of the PSA level before RT, Gleason Grade Group, PSA nadir, and local failure as a treatment indication. Finally, the nomogram for DFS was developed and is available online at https://apps.konsta.com.pl/app/prostate-salvage-dfs/.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The Pre-RT PSA level, pT3 characteristic and local failure as salvage indication are pivotal prognostic factors associated with increased risk of recurrence or progression. The Gleason grade group of 4-5 and PSA nadir value allow for further risk stratification. The treatment outcomes in postoperative prostate cancer irradiation are significantly different depending on treatment indication. An online nomogram comprising of both pre-treatment and current data was developed allowing for visualization of changes in prognosis depending on clinical data.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

33832071,Genomic analysis of pancreatic cancer reveals 3 molecular subtypes with different clinical outcomes.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>Pancreatic cancer has a very high mortality with a 5-year survival of <5%. The purpose of this study was to classify specific molecular subtypes associated with prognosis of pancreatic cancer using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multiplatform genomic data.Multiplatform genomic data (N = 178), including gene expression, copy number alteration, and somatic mutation data, were obtained from cancer browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu, cohort: TCGA Pancreatic Cancer). Clinical data including survival results were analyzed. We also used validation cohort (GSE50827) to confirm the robustness of these molecular subtypes in pancreatic cancer.When we performed unsupervised clustering using TCGA gene expression data, we found three distinct molecular subtypes associated with different survival results. Copy number alteration and somatic mutation data showed different genomic patterns for these three subtypes. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that each subtype showed differentially altered pathways. Using each subtype-specific genes (200 were selected), we could predict molecular subtype in another cohort, confirming the robustness of these molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer. Cox regression analysis revealed that molecular subtype is the only significant prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer (P = .042, 95% confidence interval 0.523-0.98).Genomic analysis of pancreatic cancer revealed 3 distinct molecular subtypes associated with different survival results. Using these subtype-specific genes and prediction model, we could predict molecular subtype associated with prognosis of pancreatic cancer.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33851388,Acquired FXIII Deficiency is Associated with High Morbidity.,"<h4>Background</h4> A factor XIII (FXIII) level >30% is considered necessary to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Bleeding is also a risk in patients with acquired FXIII deficiency, but the hemostatic level of FXIII in this context remains to be determined.<h4>Methods</h4> We retrospectively analyzed all patients diagnosed with acquired FXIII deficiency at a large hospital over 3 years (study ID NCT04416594, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and assessed clinical data to identify the best cut-off point for FXIII activity to distinguish between low and high risk of major bleeding in a mixed medical and surgical population.<h4>Results</h4> Of the 97 patients who experienced bleeding despite a normal coagulation test, 43.2% had FXIII activity <70%. FXIII activity was significantly lower in surgical patients and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Low FXIII activity was significantly associated with long ICU stays and a high incidence of major bleeding.<h4>Conclusion</h4> Acquired FXIII deficiency is associated with high morbidity. The hemostatic level of FXIII in the setting of acquired FXIII deficiency might be above 30%.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33870774,The association between relationship strain and emotional well-being among older adult couples: the moderating role of social connectedness.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The present study examines the moderating role of social connectedness (i.e. closeness, talk frequency, social network size, and neighborhood social ties) in the association between one's own and spouse's relationship strain and emotional well-being (i.e. depressive symptoms, happiness, and loneliness).<h4>Method</h4>Married couples (<i>N</i> = 865) were drawn from the second wave of the National Social, Health, and Aging Project. One Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) and one Actor Partner Interdependence Model with Moderation (APIMoM) were conducted.<h4>Results</h4>In terms of actor effects, relationship strain was associated with all emotional well-being outcomes. Wives' and husbands' greater relationship strain was associated with spouses' loneliness. Only wives' greater relationship strain was associated with her husbands' higher level of depressive symptoms and no partner effects were found for happiness. In six instances, social connectedness factors helped to ameliorate the association between self/spouse relationship strain, depressive symptoms, and happiness. However, wives' greater neighborhood social ties amplified the association between wives greater relationship strain and husbands' greater depressive symptoms. We did not find that social connectedness factors moderated the associations between self/spouse relationship strain and loneliness.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Even in late life marriages, marital strain is associated with less happiness and greater depressive symptoms and loneliness. Practitioners addressing emotional well-being may need to pay attention to spousal perceptions of relationship strain and social relationships external to the marital relationship when working with heterosexual couples. Efforts throughout the life course should be made to ensure connections with diverse types of social networks.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1910786.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33951459,Hotspot identifies informative gene modules across modalities of single-cell genomics.,"Two fundamental aims that emerge when analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data are identifying which genes vary in an informative manner and determining how these genes organize into modules. Here, we propose a general approach to these problems, called """"Hotspot,"""" that operates directly on a given metric of cell-cell similarity, allowing for its integration with any method (linear or non-linear) for identifying the primary axes of transcriptional variation between cells. In addition, we show that when using multimodal data, Hotspot can be used to identify genes whose expression reflects alternative notions of similarity between cells, such as physical proximity in a tissue or clonal relatedness in a cell lineage tree. In this manner, we demonstrate that while Hotspot is capable of identifying genes that reflect nuanced transcriptional variability between T helper cells, it can also identify spatially dependent patterns of gene expression in the cerebellum as well as developmentally heritable expression programs during embryogenesis. Hotspot is implemented as an open-source Python package and is available for use at http://www.github.com/yoseflab/hotspot.

33968128,The Molecular Functions of MeCP2 in Rett Syndrome Pathology.,"MeCP2 protein, encoded by the <i>MECP2</i> gene, binds to DNA and affects transcription. Outside of this activity the true range of MeCP2 function is still not entirely clear. As <i>MECP2</i> gene mutations cause the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome in 1 in 10,000 female births, much of what is known about the biologic function of MeCP2 comes from studying human cell culture models and rodent models with <i>Mecp2</i> gene mutations. In this review, the full scope of MeCP2 research available in the NIH Pubmed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) data base to date is considered. While not all original research can be mentioned due to space limitations, the main aspects of MeCP2 and Rett syndrome research are discussed while highlighting the work of individual researchers and research groups. First, the primary functions of MeCP2 relevant to Rett syndrome are summarized and explored. Second, the conflicting evidence and controversies surrounding emerging aspects of MeCP2 biology are examined. Next, the most obvious gaps in MeCP2 research studies are noted. Finally, the most recent discoveries in MeCP2 and Rett syndrome research are explored with a focus on the potential and pitfalls of novel treatments and therapies.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34007002,Severity modeling of propionic acidemia using clinical and laboratory biomarkers.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To conduct a proof-of-principle study to identify subtypes of propionic acidemia (PA) and associated biomarkers.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from a clinically diverse PA patient population ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02890342 ) were used to train and test machine learning models, identify PA-relevant biomarkers, and perform validation analysis using data from liver-transplanted participants. k-Means clustering was used to test for the existence of PA subtypes. Expert knowledge was used to define PA subtypes (mild and severe). Given expert classification, supervised machine learning (support vector machine with a polynomial kernel, svmPoly) performed dimensional reduction to define relevant features of each PA subtype.<h4>Results</h4>Forty participants enrolled in the study; five underwent liver transplant. Analysis with k-means clustering indicated that several PA subtypes may exist on the biochemical continuum. The conventional PA biomarkers, plasma total 2-methylctirate and propionylcarnitine, were not statistically significantly different between nontransplanted and transplanted participants motivating us to search for other biomarkers. Unbiased dimensional reduction using svmPoly revealed that plasma transthyretin, alanine:serine ratio, GDF15, FGF21, and in vivo 1-<sup>13</sup>C-propionate oxidation, play roles in defining PA subtypes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Support vector machine prioritized biomarkers that helped classify propionic acidemia patients according to severity subtypes, with important ramifications for future clinical trials and management of PA.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34013078,Host pharmacogenetic factors that may affect liver neoplasm incidence upon using direct-acting antivirals for treating hepatitis C infection.,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) represent a breakthrough in hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment as they directly inhibit HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS3/4A, NS5A, and NS5B). However, ongoing debates exist regarding their relationship with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose incidence is widely debated among investigators. This study was conducted to identify host pharmacogenetic factors that may influence HCC incidence upon using HCV DAAs.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Details regarding 16 HCV DAAs were collected from literature and DrugBank database. Digital structures of these drugs were fed into the pharmacogenomics/pharmacovigilance <i>in</i> <i>-</i> <i>silico</i> pipeline (PHARMIP) to predict the genetic factors that may underpin HCC development.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 184 unique genes and 40 unique variants that may have key answers for the DAA/HCC paradox. These findings could be used in different methods to aid in the precise application of HCV DAAs and minimize the proposed risk for HCC. All results could be accessed at: https://doi.org/10.17632/8ws8258hn3.2.<h4>Discussion</h4>All the identified factors are evidence related to HCC and significantly predicted by PHARMIP as DAA targets. We discuss some examples of the methods of using these results to address the DAA/HCC controversy based on the following three primary levels: 1 - individual DAA drug, 2 - DAA subclass, and 3 - the entire DAA class. Further wet laboratory investigation is required to evaluate these results.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,mendely
34019771,Practice Mediates Bidirectional Dual-Task Interference When Performing a Novel Sequential Nonword Repetition Task.,"Introduction The current study examined the extent to which practice amount mediates dual-task interference patterns associated with concurrent performance of a novel speech task and attention-demanding visuomotor task. Method A Sequential Nonword Repetition Task was used to examine the effect of practice on interference associated with concurrent performance of a Visuomotor Pursuit Task. Twenty-five young adult participants were assigned to either an Extended Practice Group or a Limited Practice Group and performed a novel Sequential Nonword Repetition Task in isolation and while performing a concurrent visuomotor pursuit rotor task. Results Participants in the Limited Practice Group who were afforded a limited amount of practice exhibited dual-task interference (i.e., dual-task performance reductions) for both the speech and visuomotor tasks (i.e., bidirectional dual-task interference). Conversely, participants in the Extended Practice Group who were afforded extended practice exhibited little-to-no observable dual-task interference on the nonword repetition task. Conclusion Data from the current investigation suggest that the amount of initial practice mediates the degree of dual-task interference observed when a novel speech production task is performed with an attention-demanding Visuomotor Pursuit Task.

34019885,Interventions to decrease complications after shoulder dystocia: a systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis.,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes associated with the implementation of simulation exercises to reduce the sequela of shoulder dystocia.<h4>Data sources</h4>Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature database, and Scopus) were initially queried in June 2020 and updated in November 2020. The following 3 concepts were introduced and refined using the controlled vocabulary of the database: vaginal birth, shoulder dystocia, and simulation training. There were no limitations to the year of publication as part of the search strategy.<h4>Study eligibility criteria</h4>We included all studies that reported on the frequency of shoulder dystocia and the associated complications before and after the implementation of interventional exercises to improve outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Two authors independently assessed the abstracts and full-text articles of all studies for eligibility and evaluated the quality of the included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Any inconsistencies related to study evaluation or data extraction were resolved by a third author. The coprimary outcomes of this systematic review and meta-analysis were neonatal brachial plexus palsy diagnosed following deliveries complicated by shoulder dystocia and persistence of brachial palsy at 12 months or later. The secondary outcomes were the frequency of shoulder dystocia and cesarean delivery. Study effects were combined using a Bayesian meta-analysis and were reported as risk ratios and 95% credible intervals (Crs).<h4>Results</h4>Of the 372 articles reviewed, 16 publications, which included 428,552 deliveries with 217,713 (50.8%) deliveries during the preintervention and 210,839 (49.2%) deliveries during the postinterventional period, were included in the meta-analysis. The incidence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy after shoulder dystocia decreased from 12.1% to 5.7% (risk ratio, 0.37; 95% Cr, 0.26-0.57; probability of reduction 100%). The overall proportion of neonatal brachial plexus palsy decreased, but with less precision, from 0.3% to 0.1% (risk ratio, 0.53; 95% Cr, 0.21-1.26; probability of reduction 94%). Two studies followed newborns with brachial plexus palsy for at least 12 months. One study that reported on persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy at 12 months among 1148 shoulder dystocia cases noted a reduction in persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy from 1.9% to 0.2% of shoulder dystocia cases (risk ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.49). In contrast, the study that reported on persistent neonatal brachial plexus palsy at 12 months for all deliveries noted that it did not change significantly, namely from 0.3 to 0.2 per 1000 births (risk ratio, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-1.90). Following the implementation of shoulder dystocia interventional exercises, the diagnosis of shoulder dystocia increased significantly from 1.2% to 1.7% of vaginal deliveries (risk ratio, 1.39; 95% Cr, 1.19-1.65; probability of increase 100%). Compared with the preimplementation period, the cesarean delivery rate increased postimplementation from 21.2% to 25.9% (risk ratio, 1.22; 95% Cr, 0.93-1.59; probability of increase 93%). We created an online tool (https://ccrebm-bell.shinyapps.io/sdmeta/) that permits calculation of the absolute risk reduction and absolute risk increase attributable to the intervention vis-�-vis the incidence of shoulder dystocia, neonatal brachial plexus palsy, and cesarean deliveries.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Introduction of shoulder dystocia interventional exercises decreased the rate of neonatal brachial plexus palsy per shoulder dystocia case; the data on persistence of neonatal brachial plexus palsy beyond 12 months is limited and contradictory. Implementation of the interventions was associated with an increase in the diagnosis of shoulder dystocia and rate of cesarean deliveries.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,calcualtion tool
34030448,Genomic Approaches to Plant-Pathogen Epidemiology and Diagnostics.,"Diseases have a significant cost to agriculture. Findings from analyses of whole-genome sequences show great promise for informing strategies to mitigate risks from diseases caused by phytopathogens. Genomic approaches can be used to dramatically shorten response times to outbreaks and inform disease management in novel ways. However, the use of these approaches requires expertise in working with big, complex data sets and an understanding of their pitfalls and limitations to infer well-supported conclusions. We suggest using an evolutionary framework to guide the use of genomic approaches in epidemiology and diagnostics of plant pathogens. We also describe steps that are necessary for realizing these as standard approaches in disease surveillance.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,how did this get in??
34043002,Identification of evolutionarily stable functional and immunogenic sites across the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and greater coronavirus family.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Since the first recognized case of COVID-19, more than 100 million people have been infected worldwide. Global efforts in drug and vaccine development to fight the disease have yielded vaccines and drug candidates to cure COVID-19. However, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants threatens the continued efficacy of these treatments. In order to address this, we interrogate the evolutionary history of the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome to identify evolutionarily conserved functional sites that can inform the search for treatments with broader coverage across the coronavirus family.<h4>Results</h4>Combining coronavirus family sequence information with the mutations observed in the current COVID-19 outbreak, we systematically and comprehensively define evolutionarily stable sites that may provide useful drug and vaccine targets and which are less likely to be compromised by the emergence of new virus strains. Several experimentally-validated effective drugs interact with these proposed target sites. In addition, the same evolutionary information can prioritize cross reactive antigens that are useful in directing multi-epitope vaccine strategies to illicit broadly neutralizing immune responses to the betacoronavirus family. Although the results are focused on SARS-CoV-2, these approaches stem from evolutionary principles that are agnostic to the organism or infective agent.<h4>Availability</h4>The results of this work are made interactively available at http://cov.lichtargelab.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

In this perspective, the authors share an approach for discussing a�patient's pre-visit health-related internet findings. After emphasizing the importance of setting the stage, they describe the WWW Framework which proposes """"waiting"""" before responding with data, getting to the """"what"""" of the patient's search, and """"working together"""" to negotiate a plan.

34123499,ML-SIM: universal reconstruction of structured illumination microscopy images using transfer learning.,"Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) has become an important technique for optical super-resolution imaging because it allows a doubling of image resolution at speeds compatible with live-cell imaging. However, the reconstruction of SIM images is often slow, prone to artefacts, and requires multiple parameter adjustments to reflect different hardware or experimental conditions. Here, we introduce a versatile reconstruction method, ML-SIM, which makes use of transfer learning to obtain a parameter-free model that generalises beyond the task of reconstructing data recorded by a specific imaging system for a specific sample type. We demonstrate the generality of the model and the high quality of the obtained reconstructions by application of ML-SIM on raw data obtained for multiple sample types acquired on distinct SIM microscopes. ML-SIM is an end-to-end deep residual neural network that is trained on an auxiliary domain consisting of simulated images, but is transferable to the target task of reconstructing experimental SIM images. By generating the training data to reflect challenging imaging conditions encountered in real systems, ML-SIM becomes robust to noise and irregularities in the illumination patterns of the raw SIM input frames. Since ML-SIM does not require the acquisition of experimental training data, the method can be efficiently adapted to any specific experimental SIM implementation. We compare the reconstruction quality enabled by ML-SIM with current state-of-the-art SIM reconstruction methods and demonstrate advantages in terms of generality and robustness to noise for both simulated and experimental inputs, thus making ML-SIM a useful alternative to traditional methods for challenging imaging conditions. Additionally, reconstruction of a SIM stack is accomplished in less than 200 ms on a modern graphics processing unit, enabling future applications for real-time imaging. Source code and ready-to-use software for the method are available at http://ML-SIM.github.io.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

34193950,Identification of subtypes of anticancer peptides based on sequential features and physicochemical properties.,"Anticancer peptides (ACPs) are a kind of bioactive peptides which could be used as a novel type of anticancer drug that has several advantages over chemistry-based drug, including high specificity, strong tumor penetration capacity, and low toxicity to normal cells. As the number of experimentally verified bioactive peptides has increased significantly, various of in silico approaches are imperative for investigating the characteristics of ACPs. However, the lack of methods for investigating the differences in physicochemical properties of ACPs. In this study, we compared the N- and C-terminal amino acid composition for each peptide, there are three major subtypes of ACPs that are defined based on the distribution of positively charged residues. For the first time, we were motivated to develop a two-step machine learning model for identification of the subtypes of ACPs, which classify the input data into the corresponding group before applying the classifier. Further, to improve the predictive power, the hybrid feature sets were considered for prediction. Evaluation by five-fold cross-validation showed that the two-step model trained with sequence-based features and physicochemical properties was most effective in discriminating between ACPs and non-ACPs. The two-step model trained with the hybrid features performed well, with a sensitivity of 86.75%, a specificity of 85.75%, an accuracy of 86.08%, and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient value of 0.703. Furthermore, the model also consistently provides the effective performance in independent testing set, with sensitivity of 77.6%, specificity of 94.74%, accuracy of 88.99% and the MCC value reached 0.75.

34210950,Exploration of the Important Role of Microfibril-Associated Protein 4 Gene in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common tumor of the head and neck. Its treatment usually requires multiple modalities. Currently, there are no molecular biomarkers to guide these treatment strategies. Studies have shown that microfibril-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is potentially useful for non-invasive assessment of various diseases; however, its biological function in tumors is still unknown. In this study, we propose that MFAP4 is a new prognostic target for OSCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS First, we collected OSCC data (GSE25099 and GSE30784 datasets) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and compared the differential expression of MFAP4 gene between the patients (tumor) and normal (control) groups. The comparison was done with University of California Santa Cruz Xena (https://xenabrowser.net/Datapages/), and we calculated the difference in MFAP4 gene expression between normal and tumor tissues in a pan-cancer analysis. Then, we compared the 2 groups with high and low expression of MFAP4 gene in terms of tumor mutation burden (TMB), miRNA regulation, and immune cell infiltration. RESULTS We found that the expression of MFAP4 gene was significantly decreased in tumors. Our research also showed that high expression of MFAP4 was related to better prognosis of patients and may be related to tumor gene mutation, miRNA regulation, and infiltration of different immune cells. CONCLUSIONS Our work provides evidence that expression of MFAP4 can be used as a prognostic biomarker for risk stratification of OSCC patients and elaborates on its relation with the regulation of TMB, miRNAs, and immune cell infiltration.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
34263466,Prediction of overall survival in patients with Stage I esophageal cancer: A novel web-based calculator.,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>In this study, we aimed to develop a convenient web-based calculator to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with Stage I esophageal cancer (EC).<h4>Methods</h4>Data of 1664 patients, between 2004 and 2015, were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was employed to sift variables; subsequently, Cox proportional hazards regression model was built. We applied the enhanced bootstrap validation to appraise the discrimination and calibration of the model. Clinical benefit was measured using decision curve analysis (DCA). Thereafter, a web-based calculator based on the model, which could be used to predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates, was developed.<h4>Results</h4>Race, age, histologic type, grade, N stage, and therapeutic methods were selected. C-indices of the prediction model in the training and validation groups were 0.726 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.679-0.773) and 0.724 (95% CI, 0.679-0.769), respectively. Calibration curves showed good agreement between the groups. The DCA demonstrated that the prediction model is clinically useful.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prediction model we developed showed a good performance in calculating the OS rates in patients with Stage I EC.

However, published data is often inconsistent resulting from different methods that are not precisely described in most studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We applied a well-proven enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure calcitonin gene-related peptide concentrations in human blood plasma, we modified parameters of plasma preparation and protein purification and used calcitonin gene-related peptide-free plasma for standard solutions, which are described in detail.<h4>Results</h4>Calcitonin gene-related peptide levels are stable in plasma with peptidase inhibitors and after deep-freezing. Calcitonin gene-related peptide standard solutions based on synthetic intercellular fluid or pooled plasma with pre-absorbed calcitonin gene-related peptide influenced the measurements but yielded both comprehensible results. In a sample of 56 healthy subjects the calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels varied considerably from low (<50 pg/mL) to very high (>500 pg/mL) values. After a 12-hour exposure of these subjects to normobaric hypoxia the individual calcitonin gene-related peptide levels remained stable.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Buffering with peptidase inhibitors and immediate freezing or processing of plasma samples is essential to achieve reliable measurements. Individuals show considerable differences and partly high calcitonin gene-related peptide plasma levels without detectable pathological reason. Thus plasma measurements are suited particularly to follow calcitonin gene-related peptide levels in longitudinal studies.The use of data for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the MedicalUniversity of Innsbruck (https://www.i-med.ac.at/ethikkommission/; EK Nr: 1242/2017).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The GL content in maca, which is recognized as a """"superfood"""", is approximately 100-times higher than that in other brassicas. Although maca is a potential dietary source of GLs, limited studies have examined the bioactivity of maca GLs using the combination of chemical characterization and bioassays. In this study, the fractions (Lm-II and Lm-III) rich in intact GLs (glucotropaeolin and glucolimnanthin) were isolated and characterized from maca ethanolic extracts using chromatography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, the growth-inhibitory effects of Lm-II and Lm-II fractions against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2/C3A) and colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) cell lines were examined in the absence or presence of myrosinase (MYR). Fractions lacking low molecular weight sugars dose-dependently exerted cytotoxic effects in the presence of MYR. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of Lm-II and Lm-III against HepG2/C3A were 118.8 and 69.9 �g/mL, respectively, while those against HT29 were 102.6 and 71.5 �g/mL, respectively. These results suggest that the anticancer properties of maca can be attributed to GLs and corroborate the categorization of maca as a """"superfood.""""Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.1952444.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

However, IFA intake for the recommended period is still very low in low-income countries including Ethiopia. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess both individual-and community-level determinants of IFA intake for the recommended period among pregnant women in Ethiopia.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were retrieved from the Demographic and Health Survey program's official database website (http://dhsprogram.com). A two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique was employed to conduct the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. A sample of 3088 pregnant women who had received at least one dose of IFA in Ethiopia were included in this study. A multivariable multilevel logistic regression analysis model was fitted to identify the determinants of IFA intake below the recommended period [< 90 days] during pregnancy. Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) was used during the model selection procedure.<h4>Results</h4>This study revealed that 87.6% [95% CI; 86.3%, 88.6%] of the women took IFA below the recommended period during the index pregnancy. After adjusting for the covariates: living in rural areas [AOR = 1.74: 95% CI 1.37, 2.50], and women's illiterate proportion [AOR = 1.43: 95% CI 1.06, 1.70] were community level factors. Whereas, primary education level [AOR = 0.63: 95% CI 0.40, 0.78], poorer wealth index [AOR = 1.53: 95% CI 1.08, 3.09], 4 + antenatal care visits [AOR = 0.43: 95% CI 0.31, 0.69], and receive nutritional counseling during pregnancy [AOR = 0.63: 95% CI 0.37, 0.84] were the individual-level factors of IFA intake below the recommended period during pregnancy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this study, nearly nine out of ten pregnant women did not take IFA for the recommended period. Thus, promoting recommended ANC visits, enhancing the quality of nutritional counseling, strengthening the expansion of media, and educate rural women towards the importance of optimal intake of IFA during pregnancy. Besides, the policymakers should design essential strategies based on identified barriers to improve the IFA intake for the recommended period.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

We recognize ten species previously attributed to a single Neotropical species, Cales noacki Howard, which in the strict sense is a species broadly disseminated to control woolly whitefly. A neotype is designated for C. noacki, and it is redescribed based on specimens molecularly determined to be conspecific with the neotype. Newly described species include: C. bicolor Mottern, n.sp., C. breviclava Mottern, n.sp., C. brevisensillum Mottern n.sp., C. curvigladius Mottern, n.sp., C. longiseta Mottern, n.sp., C. multisensillum Mottern n.sp., C. noyesi Mottern, n.sp., C. parvigladius Mottern, n.sp. and C. rosei Mottern, n.sp. Species are delimited based on a combination of morphological and molecular data (28S-D2 rDNA and COI). Additional specimens are included in the phylogenetic analyses and although these likely represent several new species, we lack sufficient specimen sampling to describe them at this time. Cales are highly morphologically conserved and character-poor, resulting in several cryptic species. A molecular phylogeny of the known Neotropical species based on 28S-D2�5 rDNA and a 390-bp segment of COI is included, and identification keys to males and females are provided.

IND604793137,"Re‐evolution of a morphological precursor of crypsis investment in the newly revised horned praying mantises (Insecta, Mantodea, Vatinae)","The Neotropical praying mantis tribe Vatini St�l is revised using total evidence phylogenetic analysis based on molecular and coded morphological data. The subfamily Vatinae is redefined to only include Neotropical taxa with the removal of distantly related African and Asian lineages. A new tribe is erected under Vatinae (Heterovatini trib.n.) for two unique genera with historically unstable taxonomic placement (Heterovates Saussure and Chopardiella Giglio-Tos). Phylogenetic results and morphology support the synonymy of three genera (Lobovates Deeleman-Reinhold, Phyllovates Kirby, and Hagiotata Saussure & Zehntner) and the validity of Chopardiella Giglio-Tos, Heterovates Saussure, Callivates Roy, Pseudovates Saussure, Vates Burmeister, and Zoolea Audinet Serville. A new genus (Alangularis gen.n.) is created for a former species of Vates with unique morphology and separate phylogenetic placement. All genera are redescribed based on external morphology and the male genital complex. A key to genera for Vatinae is provided with dorsal habitus images of representatives for each genus. A distinct pattern of correlated evolution of morphological characters linked to crypsis was uncovered. Cuticular leg lobes within single leg segments are evolving as sets, and serially homologous lobes appear simultaneously or in close succession. The posteroventral lobes in the apical position on thoracic femora appear to be the precursors to multiple positive rate shifts in the evolutionary accumulation of cryptic features. One shift occurred early in the evolution of Vatinae while the second occurred much later, after the loss and re-evolution of the posteroventral lobes in the apical position on thoracic femora, a violation of Dollo's law.

IND605724905,Omics analysis of acetic acid tolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"Acetic acid is an inhibitor in industrial processes such as wine making and bioethanol production from cellulosic hydrolysate. It causes energy depletion, inhibition of metabolic enzyme activity, growth arrest and ethanol productivity losses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of the yeast responses to acetic acid stress is essential for improving acetic acid tolerance and ethanol production. Although 329 genes associated with acetic acid tolerance have been identified in the Saccharomyces genome and included in the database (http://www.yeastgenome.org/observable/resistance_to_acetic_acid/overview), the cellular mechanistic responses to acetic acid remain unclear in this organism. Post-genomic approaches such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and chemogenomics are being applied to yeast and are providing insight into the mechanisms and interactions of genes, proteins and other components that together determine complex quantitative phenotypic traits such as acetic acid tolerance. This review focuses on these omics approaches in the response to acetic acid in S. cerevisiae. Additionally, several novel strains with improved acetic acid tolerance have been engineered by modifying key genes, and the application of these strains and recently acquired knowledge to industrial processes is also discussed.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
IND605918011,Genetic diversity of endangered orchid Phaius australis across a fragmented Australian landscape,"Historical events such as colonisation, spatial distribution across different habitats, and contemporary processes, such as human-mediated habitat fragmentation can leave lasting imprints on the population genetics of a species. Orchids currently comprise 17% of threatened flora species in Australia (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) due to the combination of fragmentation and illegal harvesting (Benwell in Recovery plan, swamp orchids Phaius australis, Phaius tancarvilliae, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, Sydney, 1994; Jones in A complete guide to native orchids of Australia including the island territories, 2nd�edn, Reed Natural History, Sydney, 2006; DE in Phaius australis in species profile and threats database, Department of the Environment. http://www.environment.gov.au/sprat , 2015). The federally endangered Swamp Orchid Phaius australis has a disjunct distribution across an almost 2000�km latitudinal range along Australia�s east coast but it was estimated that 95% of the populations have been lost since European settlement (Benwell 1994). Phaius australis is endangered due to illegal collection and habitat loss that has resulted in limited connectivity between populations, in ecosystems that are vulnerable to climate change. Thus the genetic impacts of its history combined with more recent fragmentation may have impacts on its future viability especially in light of changing environmental conditions. Thirty-four populations were sampled from tropical north Queensland to the southern edge of the subtropics in New South Wales. Population genetics analysis was conducted using 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers developed for the species using NextGen sequencing. Spatial genetic patterns indicate post-colonisation divergence from the tropics southwards to its current climate niche limits. Genetic diversity is low across all populations (A = 1.5, H <U+2091> =�0.171), and there is little evidence of genetic differentiation between regions. Consistent with population genetic theory, the historic loss of populations has resulted in significantly lower genetic diversity in small populations compared to large (P, A, He; p < 0.05). The viability and persistence of P. australis populations now and in a changing climate are discussed in the context of conservation priorities.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
IND606755271,Visual features based automated identification of fish species using deep convolutional neural networks,"Morphological based fish species identification is an erroneous and time-consuming process. There are numerous fish species and due to their close resemblance with each other, it is difficult to classify them by external characters. Recently, computer vision and deep learning-based identification of different animal species is being widely used by the researchers. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most analytically powerful tools in deep learning architecture for the image classification based on visual features. This work aims to propose a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species identification. The proposed CNN architecture contains 32 deep layers that are considerably deep to derive valuable and discriminating features from the image. The deep supervision is inflicted on the VGGNet architecture to increase the classification performance by instantly adding four convolutional layers to the training of each level in the network. To test the performance of proposed 32-Layer CNN architecture, we developed a dataset termed as Fish-Pak and is publicly available at Mendeley data (Fish-Pak: https://doi.org/10.17632/n3ydw29sbz.3#folder-6b024354-bae3-460a-a758-352685ba0e38). Fish-Pak contains 915 images with six distinct classes; Ctenopharyngodon idella (Grass carp), Cyprinus carpio (Common carp), Cirrhinus mrigala (Mori), Labeo rohita (Rohu), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver carp), and Catla catla (Thala) and three different image views (head region, body shape, and scale). To ensure the superior performance of proposed CNN architecture, we have carried out the experimental comparison with other deep learning frameworks involving VGG-16 for transfer learning, one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, LeNet-5, AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet-50 on the Fish-Pak data set. Comprehensive empirical analyses reveal that the proposed method achieves state of the art performance and outperforms existing methods.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,mendley data
IND606827856,Occurrence of the Stunt Nematode Neodolichorhynchus sulcatus as Pathogen of Pepper (Capsicum annuum) in Israel,"Stunt nematodes, family Dolichodoridae, are migratory ectoparasites of roots. They feed on epidermal cells by inserting only the stylet tip into the cell�s surface tissue. As one of the less common stunt nematodes, little is known about Neodolichorhynchus sulcatus (de Guiran, 1967) Jairajpuri & Hunt, 1984. To date, it has been reported from Morocco (de Guiran 1967), Spain (Tobar-Jime�nez 1970), Cameroon (Sakwe and Geraert 1991), India (Sultan et al. 1995), and Iran (Pourjam et al. 2011). This is the first detection of N. sulcatus infecting pepper (variety 1204 Alef Beit Zeraim) root from a farm in Ein Yahav, Arava Rift, Israel (30�39'54.3''N, 35�15'02.9''E). In March 2019, we observed decline in development of pepper plants. We recovered nematodes from the pepper root zone at high population density. Nematodes were extracted from the soil using the Baermann tray technique. Identification was based on a combination of molecular and morphological methods. Genomic DNA was extracted from a single fresh nematode; amplicons from 18S rRNA, 28S D2 to D3 rRNA, and the intergenic spacer (ITS) region were generated following the procedure detailed in Qing et al. (2019); and sequencing was performed. The sequences were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers MK96525 to MK965256 (28S), MK965252 (18S), and MK965249 and MK965250 (ITS), providing the first rRNA data for N. sulcatus. Phylogenetic analysis placed this species as sister to Bitylenchus iphilus in 18S (98.15% similar in BLAST), sister to Paratrophurus bhutanensis in 28S (91.68% similar in BLAST), or sister to a well-supported clade containing B. iphilus (91.35% similar in BLAST, highest match), B. maximus, B. hispaniensis, P. bhutanensis, and P. bursifer in ITS (figures for phylogeny trees available at https://photos.app.goo.gl/2Y7fToEftBopbnB67). Although our species were not clustered with other Neodolichorhynchus species, morphology and morphometry confirmed its identity as N. sulcatus, including the cephalic region offset, basal bulb pyriform, a cuticle with 16 longitudinal ridges including the lateral fields, irregularly areolated lateral fields with three ridges, bursa not notched at tail tip, gubernaculum with smooth proximal end, and vulva lacking lateral flaps, tail cylindroid-conical with rounded and smooth terminus. Measurements (mean � standard error, range, in �m) for female (n = 10): body length 801 � 49.4 (731 to 901), anterior end to vulva 435 � 34.8 (410 to 520), V value 54.2 � 1.69 (52.4 to 57.7), lip height 4.53 � 0.31 (4.39 to 5.41), stylet length 21.4 � 0.37 (20.6 to 21.8), cone of stylet 11.4 � 0.63 (10.7 to 12.8), anterior end to center of median bulb 86.0 � 3.53 (78.7 to 91.3), pharynx length 146 � 4.05 (139 to 153), maximum body width 25.6 � 1.00 (24 to 27), anus/cloacal width 15.7 � 1.39 (14.3 to 17.9), tail length 47.2 � 3.85 (43.4 to 56.5); for male (n = 7): body length 786 � 64.0 (704 to 874), lip height 4.34 � 0.55 (3.67 to 5.24), stylet length 20.4 � 0.73 (19.7 to 21.7), cone of stylet 10.9 � 0.82 (10.3 to 12.7), anterior end to median bulb 81.2 � 3.54 (75.2 to 87), pharynx length 138 � 6.66 (132 to 148), maximum body width 22.6 � 2.15 (20.4 to 25.8), anus/cloacal width 17.7 � 1.50 (15.2 to 19.9), tail length 54.7 � 5.67 (46.6 to 62.6), spicule length 26.3 � 1.21 (24.2 to 27.6). To confirm pathogenicity, we performed inoculation assays in greenhouse conditions. Individual nematodes were manually picked, and 300 juveniles were inoculated onto healthy pepper (variety Maccabi) roots growing in sterile soil in a greenhouse. Three pots with four pepper plants per pot were inoculated, and three noninoculated pots served as a control. Nematodes were harvested from the root and soil 40 days after inoculation, yielding an average of 483 � 75 nematodes per pot. We observed a reduction in plant growth and necrotic spots on the roots similar to those infected pepper in Ein Yahav. These results confirmed the nematode�s pathogenicity to pepper. This is the first report of N. sulcatus infecting pepper plants in Israel.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
IND607322953,First Report of Grapevine Red Globe Virus in Grapevines in Washington State,"Grapevine red globe virus (GRGV; genus Maculavirus, family Tymoviridae) has been reported in grapevines (Vitis spp.) from Italy, Greece, France, China, Spain, and Germany and in California, U.S.A. (Cretazzo et al. 2017; Fan et al. 2016; Ruiz-Garcia et al. 2018; Sabanadzovic et al. 2000). During surveys of grapevine nurseries, a total of 241 composite samples, each consisting of four petioles from mature leaves/vine from five asymptomatic grapevines, from 33 grapevine (Vitis vinifera) cultivars were collected. Total RNA isolated from these samples using a Spectrum Total RNA isolation kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was subjected to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on an Illumina HiSeq2500 or NovaSeq 6000 platform in paired-end mode (Genomics Core Facility, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Utah University, Salt Lake City, UT). After trimming raw reads based on quality and ambiguity, the paired-end quality reads of approximately 120 (HiSeq) or 145 (NovaSeq) base pair (bp) length were assembled de novo into a pool of contigs (CLC Genomics Workbench 12). These contigs were subjected to BLASTn analysis against the nonredundant virus database from GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). A total of 49 contig sequences, ranging from 200 to 1,645 bp in length with an average coverage ranging up to 418.7, aligning with GRGV genome, were detected in cultivars Aglianico, Cabernet franc, Pinot gris, and Riesling. BLASTn analysis of contigs greater than 500 bp in length showed sequence identity between 88.5 and 95% with corresponding GRGV sequences reported from other countries. These results indicated the presence of genetically distinct isolates of GRGV. HTS data also revealed coinfection of GRGV in all samples with one or more of the following viruses and/or viroids: grapevine rupestris stem pitting associated virus, grapevine rupestris vein feathering virus, hop stunt viroid, or grapevine yellow speckle viroid-1. To further confirm infection by GRGV, total RNA was extracted from two asymptomatic Pinot gris vines that previously tested positive in HTS using the Spectrum Total RNA isolation kit and subjected to reverse transcription PCR using primers specific to the replicase polyprotein gene of the virus (RG4847F, 5'-TGGTCTGTTGTTCGCATCTT-3'; RG6076R, 5' CGGAAGGGGAAGCATTGATCT-3' Cretazzo et al. 2017). Sequence analysis of the approximately 1,250-bp amplicons (accession no. MT749359) showed 91.2% nt sequence identity with a corresponding sequence of GRGV isolate from Brazil (KX828704.1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of GRGV in Washington State. Together with the report of the occurrence of GRGV in California (Sabanadzovic et al. 2000), these results indicate wide geographical distribution of the virus. Although GRGV can cause asymptomatic infections in grapevines (Martelli et al. 2002), the economic importance of GRGV as single or coinfections with other viruses needs to be examined to assess the potential significance of the virus to grape production and grapevine certification programs.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

PMC3788421,PS3-52: Heart Health in Your Pocket: Lessons Learned from the Development of a Smartphone App,"<h4>Background/Aims</h4> As part of the Million Hearts national initiative to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD), there are increasing calls to leverage health information technology. The Marshfield Clinic developed a Heart Health Mobile application (app) that is designed to improve awareness of CVD risk and promote risk factor control among regional smartphone users. It deploys an engaging user interface that provides a brief CVD risk assessment that takes into account self-reported behavioral, familial, and biometric risk factors, including blood pressure and lipids. Users are then directed to nearby community pharmacies, clinics, and other locations where more advanced CVD risk factor screenings can be obtained. Along with social media connections and measurement prompts, basic education materials are provided on key CVD prevention topics such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, weight management, and tobacco cessation. <h4>Methods</h4> A multidisciplinary team of 24 members was created to develop the app over a 30-day timeframe. This team included a broad cross-section of clinical professionals from medicine, epidemiology, health IT, usability and graphic designers, business analytics, and marketing. An Agile programming method was used to promote adaptive planning and evolutionary development in self-organizing, cross-functional teams. <h4>Results</h4> The iOS app was successfully developed, tested, and launched within the 30-day timeframe. It was submitted competitively as part of the Million Hearts Risk Check Challenge, a CVD prevention app contest sponsored by Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. The final product is shown in detail at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfESTQipjtw. The app was developed in six different languages, and epidemiologic data on downloads, unique users, geo-segmentation, risk factor profile, and customer loyalty, among other data points, are actively collected. <h4>Conclusions</h4> Health-related consumer smartphone apps can be developed rapidly and brought to scale as part of healthcare delivery systems� business and clinical strategies. They provide users with important information, education, and directions on CVD prevention and have wide-ranging potential across numerous health conditions. From an HMORN perspective, such apps also provide real-time data collection methods that can be used to identify health trends at a lower cost (and comparable quality) relative to traditional population research methods.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

PMC5888665,T253. THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS BETWEEN RENAMING SCHIZOPHRENIA AND VISITING FREQUENCY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BY BIG DATA ANALYSIS (INTERNET SEARCHES AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES) IN SOUTH KOREA,"Abstract <h4>Background</h4> Korean Neuropsychiatric Association changed the Korean term for schizophrenia from �split-mind disorder� to �attunement disorder� in 2012, to dispel the stigma associated with name, and to promote early detection and treatment. Information on the internet affects the public awareness and attitude toward schizophrenia. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between renaming schizophrenia and the pattern of mental health services utilization by big data analysis of internet (newspaper articles and internet searches) in Korea. <h4>Methods</h4> From January 2016 to September 2017, newspaper articles on �attunement disorder� and �split-mind disorder� available on the internet were classified as related with negative images like crime and helpful or positive in dispelling the stigma. The relationship between the number of anti-stigma newspaper articles and newspaper articles of schizophrenia containing both positive and negative images was examined. In addition, using Naver, a major internet search engine in Korea, we investigated the total number of internet searches of both old and new name of schizophrenia by gender differences. Finally, the frequency of the visits of mental health services of patients with schizophrenia was measured using the Korean Healthcare Bigdata Hub (http://opendata.hira.or.kr/home.do#none) for 14 months and the correlation between the frequency of the visits and the above big data was examined. The data were analyzed using the SPSS/WIN 24.0. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to analyze correlations. <h4>Results</h4> The amounts of newspaper articles containing anti-stigma of schizophrenia were correlated with the amounts of newspaper articles containing negative images like crime of the new name (attunement disorder) of schizophrenia (r=0.528, p<0.01), which was greater than the amounts of newspaper articles containing the old name (split-mind disorder) of schizophrenia (r=0.300, p<0.01). We also found that a strong positive correlation between the number of articles about �attunement disorder� and search frequency about the term on the internet. In addition, the search frequency was more highly related to the number of articles containing negative images of the illness (e.g., related crimes, r = 0.910, p<0.01) than that of articles providing positive aspects of the illness (e.g., dispelling stigma, r = 0.423, p<0.01). There was no significant correlation between the number of schizophrenia-related newspaper articles in previous month and the visits of mental health services of patients with schizophrenia in next month. There were no gender differences in internet searches. The correlation between the internet search frequency for �attunement disorder� in the previous month and the visits of the mental health services of patients with schizophrenia (r = 0.185, p>0.05) in next month was larger than the correlation of �split-mind disorder� searches with mental health services utilization (r = 0.082, p>0.05). <h4>Discussion</h4> �Attunement disorder� rather than �split-mind disorder� was appeared more frequently in newspaper articles of the anti-stigma characteristics. �Attunement disorder� seems to be more useful for anti-stigma campaign. Renaming schizophrenia didn�t seem to affect the visiting frequency of mental health services. There was statistical limitation which was originated from the lack of numbers of patient�s information. It was because Korean Bigdata Hub provided patients information just for 14 months as monthly data. Also, it should be considered that the time period, the kinds of mental disorders and the search engine we investigated were limited. Future research needs to overcome these limitations.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Because of its potential as a support tool for CNS tumor diagnosis, Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip analysis was readily implemented and �routinely� performed on pediatric CNS tumor samples in the PMC. AIM: To identify the challenges and opportunities of methylation profiling as a support tool for the diagnosis of pediatric CNS tumors. PATIENTS AND <h4>METHODS</h4> We have now analyzed >150 pediatric (formalin-fixed/paraffin-embedded) CNS tumor samples using methylation profiling and matched the profiles with the �Heidelberg database� (https://www.molecularneuropathology.org/mnp). <h4>RESULTS</h4> In > 90% of analyzed cases, the suggested methylation class corresponded very well with the pathological (histological +/- molecular) diagnosis. In some other cases, the suggested methylation class was not very helpful because the reliability score of the test was (too) low, or because the suggested class not adequately reflected the actual presence of a tumor (e.g. �reactive/inflammatory changes�) or was not (yet) as precise as desired (e.g. �diffuse glioma/glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, midline type (but not H3-mutant)�). However, in many other cases the tool was very helpful for reaching a more precise diagnosis (esp. so for medulloblastomas, ependymomas) or directed towards the right diagnosis. <h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4> Methylation profiling is a very powerful tool to confirm, fine-tune and/or direct pediatric CNS tumor diagnostics. However, it is crucial to interpret this new level of information in the clinical, radiological and pathological context.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource

A total of 590 DNA 600 Duroc finishing pigs (BW=75.7 + 1.0 kg) were blocked by weight and sex and allocated across two dietary treatments with 6 replications per treatment and 21 to 26 pigs per pen. Dietary treatments were: barrow (B) diets with and without LF and gilt (G) diets with and without LF. Diets were formulated to split-sex requirements (CON) for each period and LF diets were control diets + 0.125% LF. The experiment was 44-d where d 0 was 98-d post-wean. All data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS as a randomized complete block design as a 2 x 2 (diet x sex) factorial arrangement. Pen served as the experimental unit. Overall (d 0-44), the B gained more weight (P = 0.0282) and consumed more feed (P > 0.10) in ADFI. There was no diet x sex interaction (P > 0.10) for ADG. There was a tendency for an interaction (P = 0.0545) for ADFI, where LF B consumed more feed compared to CON B and CON G consumed more feed compared to LF G. There was an interaction for G:F (P = 0.0028) where G on LF had higher G:F compared to G on CON whereas G:F for B was not different to B on LF. In conclusion, LF improved ADG and G:F, but did so differently for G and B.  http://www.conferenceharvester.com/","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
PMC6666854,"PSIV-13 Basal endogenous loss, standardized total tract digestibility, and retention of Ca in sows change throughout gestation, but microbial phytase reduces basal endogenous loss of Ca by gestating sows","Abstract The objective was to test the hypothesis that standardized total tract digestibility (STTD) of Ca and Ca and P retention and the response to microbial phytase in diets fed to sows are constant throughout gestation. Thirty-six sows (parity = 3.3) were allotted to 4 diets on d 7 post-breeding. Two corn-based diets in which calcium carbonate was the sole source of Ca and 2 Ca-free diets were formulated without or with phytase (500 units per kg). Sows were housed individually in metabolism crates during early-gestation, mid-gestation, and late-gestation, and feces and urine were quantitatively collected. Data were analyzed by repeated measures using a model that included phytase, period of gestation, and the interaction between phytase and period as fixed effects, and block and replicate as random effects. Interactions between period and phytase were not observed. The basal endogenous loss (BEL) of Ca was greater (P < 0.05) in early-gestation than in mid- and late-gestation, but phytase reduced (P = 0.002) BEL of Ca and tended (P = 0.099) to increase apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P in the Ca-free diet. Phytase did not affect ATTD of DM, STTD of Ca, ATTD of P, or Ca and P retention in sows fed the diet containing calcium carbonate (Table 1). The ATTD of DM was not affected by period, but Ca retention and ATTD of Ca and P were least (P < 0.05) in mid-gestation, followed by early- and late-gestation, and the STTD of Ca in mid-gestation was also reduced (P < 0.05) compared with early- or late-gestation. Phosphorus retention was greater (P < 0.05) in late-gestation than in the earlier periods. In conclusion, BEL of Ca, STTD of Ca, ATTD of P, and Ca and P retention in sows change throughout gestation regardless of use of phytase.  http://www.conferenceharvester.com/","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

PMC7989604,"112 Outcomes and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 Disease in the Frail, Elderly Population of Tayside","Abstract <h4>Introduction</h4> With advancing age, frailty, multi-morbidity and need for care, elderly patients are some of the most vulnerable to Covid-19 disease. In NHS Tayside, a dedicated Covid-19 Medicine for the Elderly (MFE) Team was formed to care for patients identified as frail and likely to benefit from comprehensive geriatric assessment. <h4>Methods</h4> All Covid-19 patients meeting frailty criteria1, cared for by the Covid-19 MFE Team were identified. Data on outcomes and clinical characteristics for all (140) patients admitted during the first pandemic wave (March�July 2020) was collected using electronic patient records and analysed. <h4>Results</h4> Patients were predominantly male (58.6%). Ages ranged from 65�99�years, with 43.6% aged =85�years. 82.1% had one or more of cough, fever and anosmia on admission fitting Covid-19 case definition 2. Lymphopenia was present in 92.1%. Of note, 26.5% of patients had a normal or unchanged chest x-ray report, with only 10.2% showing bilateral peripheral infiltrates. 28-day mortality was 37.1% with Covid-19 Disease listed as primary cause of death in 90.4%. <h4>Conclusion(s)</h4> Entering further �waves� of infection, it is vital that we understand the clinical presentation and course of Covid-19 disease in elderly patients. Our data highlights that any Covid-19 symptom, even in isolation, should raise suspicion of disease. Chest x-rays should not be used alone as a diagnostic tool. The presence of lymphopenia should raise suspicion of Covid-19 infection. In developing an understanding of how elderly patients with Covid-19 present, we can ensure early identification and initiation of appropriate infection control measures. <h4>References</h4> 1.

PMC8090191,Study of Patients’ Characteristics and Mutual Impact Between Covid-19 and Hyperglycemia at a Community Hospital in Central Brooklyn,"Abstract Background: Studies have shown that poorly-controlled hyperglycemia worsens the outcomes in patients with COVID-19 (C-19) and C-19 may damage pancreatic islets via ACE2 receptors causing acute hyperglycemia. The major population we serve at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center (KJMC) are underprivileged with many of them having multiple comorbidities. Methods: This is a retrospective study wherein patients, admitted from February 2020 to April 2020 with hyperglycemia, were selected and divided into 2 groups based on presence or absence of C-19. Data include demographics, comorbidities, blood glucose level, serum osmolality, serum bicarbonate, anion gap, acute kidney injury (AKI), serum creatinine, ICU admission, length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Data were analyzed using descriptive study and T-test. Results: 100 patients were included in the C-19 group (CG) and 88 patients were included in the Non C-19 group (NCG). Major comorbidities were similar in both groups including HTN, DM, CKD followed by ESRD. Mean age of patients (years) was 65.68 in CG and 61.17 in NCG. 61% were male in CG and 53.41% were male in NCG. 16% and 9% developed DKA and HHS in CG, and 13.64% and 6.82% developed DKA and HHS in NCG respectively. 15% in CG had combined DKA & HHS and 3.41% had same in NCG. Mean blood glucose level (mg/dl) was 541.6 in CG and 460.0 in NCG (p=0.03). Mean serum osmolality (mOsm/kg) was 335.7 (SD�41.01) in CG and 317.1 (SD�30.54) in NCG (p=0.01). Mean serum bicarbonate (mEq/L) was 17.73 (SD�6.31) in CG and 21.46 (SD�5.94) in NCG (p<0.0001). Mean anion gap was 17.93 (SD�7.6) in CG and 13.10 (SD�7.2) in NCG (p<0.0001). 56% in CG and 37% in NCG developed AKI respectively (p=0.01). Mean serum creatinine (mg/dl) was 4.22 in CG and 1.65 in NCG (p=0.004). 55% of CG were admitted to ICU and 34% of NCG were admitted to ICU (p=0.003). Median LOS (days) in discharged patients was 8 in CG and 5 in NCG (p=0.02). Mortality was 40% in CG and 3.41% in NCG (p<0.0001). 12 patients in CG and 2 patients in NCG developed new-onset diabetes. In the subset of DKA, interestingly, mean age (years) was 61.63 (SD�17.73) in CG and 39.67 in NCG (SD�13.39) (p=0.001). Conclusion: In our study, patients in the CG carry worse laboratory parameters, unfavorable clinical outcomes and strikingly higher mortality. We discovered increased incidence of new-onset diabetes and elderly DKA in CG. In an inner city population like ours, the burden of DM with significant social and health care disparities is quite severe. Diabetic patients with concurrent C-19 infection can have particularly negative outcomes and C-19 possibly damages the pancreatic islets resulting in acute hyperglycemic crisis. Further research on larger population is required.
