28961912,Enabling reproducible real-time quantitative PCR research: the RDML package.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Reproducibility, a cornerstone of research, requires defined data formats, which include the setup and output of experiments. The real-time PCR data markup language (RDML) is a recommended standard of the minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments guidelines. Despite the popularity of the RDML format for analysis of quantitative PCR data, handling of RDML files is not yet widely supported in all PCR curve analysis softwares.<h4>Results</h4>This study describes the open-source RDML package for the statistical computing language R. RDML is compatible with RDML versions ‚â§ 1.2 and provides functionality to (i) import RDML data; (ii) extract sample information (e.g. targets and concentration); (iii) transform data to various formats of the R environment; (iv) generate human-readable run summaries; and (v) to create RDML files from user data. In addition, RDML offers a graphical user interface to read, edit and create RDML files.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>https://cran.r-project.org/package=RDML. rdmlEdit server http://shtest.evrogen.net/rdmlEdit/.

BALCONY can work with residues dispersed across a protein sequence and map them on the corresponding alignment of homologous protein sequences. Additionally, it provides several entropy and variability scores that indicate the conservation of each residue.<h4>Results</h4>Our package allows the user to visualize evolutionary variability by locating the positions most likely to vary and to assess mutation candidates in protein engineering.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In comparison to other R packages BALCONY allows conservation/variability analysis in context of protein structure with linkage of the appropriate metrics with physicochemical features of user choice.<h4>Availability</h4>CRAN project page: https://cran.r-project.org/package=BALCONY and our website: http://www.tunnelinggroup.pl/software/ for major platforms: Linux/Unix, Windows and Mac OS X.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
30596886,Multiview: a software package for multiview pattern recognition methods.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Multiview datasets are the norm in bioinformatics, often under the label multi-omics. Multiview data are gathered from several experiments, measurements or feature sets available for the same subjects. Recent studies in pattern recognition have shown the advantage of using multiview methods of clustering and dimensionality reduction; however, none of these methods are readily available to the extent of our knowledge. Multiview extensions of four well-known pattern recognition methods are proposed here. Three multiview dimensionality reduction methods: multiview t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding, multiview multidimensional scaling and multiview minimum curvilinearity embedding, as well as a multiview spectral clustering method. Often they produce better results than their single-view counterparts, tested here on four multiview datasets.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>R package at the B2SLab site: http://b2slab.upc.edu/software-and-tutorials/ and Python package: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiview.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,
31114875,GEPIA2: an enhanced web server for large-scale expression profiling and interactive analysis.,"Introduced in 2017, the GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) web server has been a valuable and highly cited resource for gene expression analysis based on tumor and normal samples from the TCGA and the GTEx databases. Here, we present GEPIA2, an updated and enhanced version to provide insights with higher resolution and more functionalities. Featuring 198 619 isoforms and 84 cancer subtypes, GEPIA2 has extended gene expression quantification from the gene level to the transcript level, and supports analysis of a specific cancer subtype, and comparison between subtypes. In addition, GEPIA2 has adopted new analysis techniques of gene signature quantification inspired by single-cell sequencing studies, and provides customized analysis where users can upload their own RNA-seq data and compare them with TCGA and GTEx samples.

31372596,Accelerating structure-function mapping using the ViVa webtool to mine natural variation.,"Thousands of sequenced genomes are now publicly available capturing a significant amount of natural variation within plant species; yet, much of these data remain inaccessible to researchers without significant bioinformatics experience. Here, we present a webtool called ViVa (Visualizing Variation) which aims to empower any researcher to take advantage of the amazing genetic resource collected in the <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> 1001 Genomes Project (http://1001genomes.org). ViVa facilitates data mining on the gene, gene family, or gene network level. To test the utility and accessibility of ViVa, we assembled a team with a range of expertise within biology and bioinformatics to analyze the natural variation within the well-studied nuclear auxin signaling pathway. Our analysis has provided further confirmation of existing knowledge and has also helped generate new hypotheses regarding this well-studied pathway. These results highlight how natural variation could be used to generate and test hypotheses about less-studied gene families and networks, especially when paired with biochemical and genetic characterization. ViVa is also readily extensible to databases of interspecific genetic variation in plants as well as other organisms, such as the 3,000 Rice Genomes Project ( http://snp-seek.irri.org/) and human genetic variation ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,a tool and not descriptive of resource
31444973,CLASTR: The Cellosaurus STR similarity search tool - A precious help for cell line authentication.,"Despite an increased awareness of the problematic of cell line cross-contamination and misidentification, it remains nowadays a major source of erroneous experimental results in biomedical research. To prevent it, researchers are expected to frequently test the authenticity of the cell lines they are working on. STR profiling was selected as the international reference method to perform cell line authentication. While the experimental protocols and manipulations for generating a STR profile are well described, the available tools and workflows to analyze such data are lacking. The Cellosaurus knowledge resource aimed to improve the situation by compiling all the publicly available STR profiles from the literature and other databases. As a result, it grew to become the largest database in terms of human STR profiles, with 6,474 distinct cell lines having an associated STR profile (release July 31, 2019). Here we present CLASTR, the Cellosaurus STR similarity search tool enabling users to compare one or more STR profiles with those available in the Cellosaurus cell line knowledge resource. It aims to help researchers in the process of cell line authentication by providing numerous functionalities. The tool is publicly accessible on the SIB ExPASy server (https://web.expasy.org/cellosaurus-str-search) and its source code is available on GitHub under the GPL-3.0 license.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,"software, but specific to searching a db",
31697319,Critical evaluation of web-based prediction tools for human protein subcellular localization.,"Human protein subcellular localization has an important research value in biological processes, also in elucidating protein functions and identifying drug targets. Over the past decade, a number of protein subcellular localization prediction tools have been designed and made freely available online. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the progress of research on the subcellular localization of human proteins in recent years, including commonly used data sets proposed by the predecessors and the performance of all selected prediction tools against the same benchmark data set. We carry out a systematic evaluation of several publicly available subcellular localization prediction methods on various benchmark data sets. Among them, we find that mLASSO-Hum and pLoc-mHum provide a statistically significant improvement in performance, as measured by the value of accuracy, relative to the other methods. Meanwhile, we build a new data set using the latest version of Uniprot database and construct a new GO-based prediction method HumLoc-LBCI in this paper. Then, we test all selected prediction tools on the new data set. Finally, we discuss the possible development directions of human protein subcellular localization.

Commonly, protein-ligand docking programs have included some utilities that allow the calculation of this value; however, they only work efficiently when exists a complete atom label equivalence between the evaluated conformations. RESULTS:We present LigRMSD, a free web-server for the automatic matching and RMSD calculations among identical or similar chemical compounds. This server allows the user to submit only a pair of identical or similar molecules or dataset of similar compounds to compare their three-dimensional conformations.

32154836,iATC-FRAKEL: a simple multi-label web server for recognizing anatomical therapeutic chemical classes of drugs with their fingerprints only.,"MOTIVATION:Anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system is very important for drug utilization and studies. Correct prediction of the 14 classes in the first level for given drugs is an essential problem for the study on such system. Several multi-label classifiers have been proposed in this regard. However, only two of them provided the web servers and their performance was not very high. On the other hand, although some rest classifiers can provide better performance, they were built based on some prior knowledge on drugs, such as information of chemical-chemical interaction and chemical ontology, leading to limited applications. Furthermore, provided codes of these classifiers are almost inaccessible for pharmacologists. RESULTS:In this study, we built a simple web server, namely iATC-FRAKEL. This web server only required the SMILES format of drugs as input and extracted their fingerprints for making prediction. The performance of the iATC-FRAKEL was much higher than all existing web servers and was comparable to the best multi-label classifier but had much wider applications.

32271863,gplas: a comprehensive tool for plasmid analysis using short-read graphs.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Plasmids can horizontally transmit genetic traits, enabling rapid bacterial adaptation to new environments and hosts. Short-read whole-genome sequencing data are often applied to large-scale bacterial comparative genomics projects but the reconstruction of plasmids from these data is facing severe limitations, such as the inability to distinguish plasmids from each other in a bacterial genome. We developed gplas, a new approach to reliably separate plasmid contigs into discrete components using sequence composition, coverage, assembly graph information and network partitioning based on a pruned network of plasmid unitigs. Gplas facilitates the analysis of large numbers of bacterial isolates and allows a detailed analysis of plasmid epidemiology based solely on short-read sequence data.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Gplas is written in R, Bash and uses a Snakemake pipeline as a workflow management system.

32363380,CeRNASeek: an R package for identification and analysis of ceRNA regulation.,"Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) represents a novel layer of gene regulation that controls both physiological and pathological processes. However, there is still lack of computational tools for quickly identifying ceRNA regulation. To address this problem, we presented an R-package, CeRNASeek, which allows identifying and analyzing ceRNA-ceRNA interactions by integration of multiple-omics data. CeRNASeek integrates six widely used computational methods to identify ceRNA-ceRNA interactions, including two global and four context-specific ceRNA regulation prediction methods. In addition, it provides several downstream analyses for predicted ceRNA-ceRNA pairs, including regulatory network analysis, functional annotation and survival analysis. With examples of cancer-related ceRNA prioritization and cancer subtyping, we demonstrate that CeRNASeek is a valuable tool for investigating the function of ceRNAs in complex diseases. In summary, CeRNASeek provides a comprehensive and efficient tool for identifying and analysis of ceRNA regulation.

32569358,COVID-19 TestNorm: A tool to normalize COVID-19 testing names to LOINC codes.,"Large observational data networks that leverage routine clinical practice data in electronic health records (EHRs) are critical resources for research on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data normalization is a key challenge for the secondary use of EHRs for COVID-19 research across institutions. In this study, we addressed the challenge of automating the normalization of COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which are critical data elements, but for which controlled terminology terms were published after clinical implementation. We developed a simple but effective rule-based tool called COVID-19 TestNorm to automatically normalize local COVID-19 testing names to standard LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) codes. COVID-19 TestNorm was developed and evaluated using 568 test names collected from 8 healthcare systems. Our results show that it could achieve an accuracy of 97.4% on an independent test set. COVID-19 TestNorm is available as an open-source package for developers and as an online Web application for end users (https://clamp.uth.edu/covid/loinc.php). We believe that it will be a useful tool to support secondary use of EHRs for research on COVID-19.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
32592631,"A study on the structure, mechanism, and biochemistry of kanamycin B dioxygenase (KanJ)-an enzyme with a broad range of substrates.","Kanamycin A is an aminoglycoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces kanamyceticus and used against a wide spectrum of bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Biosynthesis of kanamycin involves an oxidative deamination step catalyzed by kanamycin B dioxygenase (KanJ), thereby the C2' position of kanamycin B is transformed into a keto group upon release of ammonia. Here, we present for the first time, structural models of KanJ with several ligands, which along with the results of ITC binding assays and HPLC activity tests explain substrate specificity of the enzyme. The large size of the binding pocket suggests that KanJ can accept a broad range of substrates, which was confirmed by activity tests. Specificity of the enzyme with respect to its substrate is determined by the hydrogen bond interactions between the methylamino group of the antibiotic and highly conserved Asp134 and Cys150 as well as between hydroxyl groups of the substrate and Asn120 and Gln80. Upon antibiotic binding, the C terminus loop is significantly rearranged and Gln80 and Asn120, which are directly involved in substrate recognition, change their conformations. Based on reaction energy profiles obtained by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we propose a mechanism of ketone formation involving the reactive Fe<sup>IV</sup>  = O and proceeding either via OH rebound, which yields a hemiaminal intermediate or by abstraction of two hydrogen atoms, which leads to an imine species. At acidic pH, the latter involves a lower barrier than the OH rebound, whereas at basic pH, the barrier leading to an imine vanishes completely.

32632821,Efficient System Wide Metabolic Pathway Comparisons in Multiple Microbes Using Genome to KEGG Orthology (G2KO) Pipeline Tool.,"Comparison of system-wide metabolic pathways among microbes provides valuable insights of organisms' metabolic capabilities that can further assist in rationally screening organisms in silico for various applications. In this work, we present a much needed, efficient and user-friendly Genome to KEGG Orthology (G2KO) pipeline tool that facilitates efficient comparison of system wide metabolic networks of multiple organisms simultaneously. The optimized strategy primarily involves automatic retrieval of the KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers of user defined organisms from the KEGG database followed by overlaying and visualization of the metabolic genes using the KEGG Mapper reconstruct pathway tool. We demonstrate the applicability of G2KO via two case studies in which we processed 24,314 genes across 15 organisms, mapped on to 530 reference pathways in KEGG, while focusing on pathways of interest. First, an in-silico designing of synthetic microbial consortia towards bioprocessing of cellulose to valuable products by comparing the cellulose degradation and fermentative pathways of microbes was undertaken. Second, we comprehensively compared the amino acid biosynthetic pathways of multiple microbes and demonstrated the potential of G2KO as an efficient tool for metabolic studies.

33064576,"Triclocarban, Triclosan, Bromochlorophene, Chlorophene, and Climbazole Effects on Nuclear Receptors: An <i>in Silico</i> and <i>in Vitro</i> Study.","<h4>Background</h4>Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can interfere with hormonal homeostasis and have adverse effects for both humans and the environment. Their identification is increasingly difficult due to lack of adequate toxicological tests. This difficulty is particularly problematic for cosmetic ingredients, because <i>in vivo</i> testing is now banned completely in the European Union.<h4>Objectives</h4>The aim was to identify candidate preservatives as endocrine disruptors by <i>in silico</i> methods and to confirm endocrine receptors' activities through nuclear receptors <i>in vitro</i>.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened preservatives listed in Annex V in the European Union Regulation on cosmetic products to predict their binding to nuclear receptors using the Endocrine Disruptome and VirtualToxLab‚Ñ¢ version 5.8 <i>in silico</i> tools. Five candidate preservatives were further evaluated for androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ERŒ±), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and thyroid receptor (TR) agonist and antagonist activities in cell-based luciferase reporter assays <i>in vitro</i> in AR-EcoScreen, hERŒ±-HeLa-9903, MDA-kb2, and GH3.TRE-Luc cell lines. Additionally, assays to test for false positives were used (nonspecific luciferase gene induction and luciferase inhibition).<h4>Results</h4>Triclocarban had agonist activity on AR and ERŒ± at 1ŒºM and antagonist activity on GR at 5ŒºM and TR at 1ŒºM. Triclosan showed antagonist effects on AR, ERŒ±, GR at 10ŒºM and TR at 5ŒºM, and bromochlorophene at 1ŒºM (AR and TR) and at 10ŒºM (ERŒ± and GR). AR antagonist activity of chlorophene was observed [inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) IC50=2.4ŒºM], as for its substantial ERŒ± agonist at >5ŒºM and TR antagonist activity at 10ŒºM. Climbazole showed AR antagonist (IC50=13.6ŒºM), ERŒ± agonist at >10ŒºM, and TR antagonist activity at 10ŒºM.<h4>Discussion</h4>These data support the concerns of regulatory authorities about the endocrine-disrupting potential of preservatives. These data also define the need to further determine their effects on the endocrine system and the need to reassess the risks they pose to human health and the environment. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6596.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33086240,The Caregiver Experience After Stroke in a COVID-19 Environment: A Qualitative Study in Inpatient Rehabilitation.,"<h4>Background and purpose</h4>Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Two-thirds of stroke survivors will require caregiver assistance. Evidence suggests the mental health of caregivers is closely related to patients' health outcomes. The timing of this study intersected with the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that required strict social distancing and hospital visitor policy changes. This study aims to answer the primary research question: What is the level and nature of stress experienced by caregivers of persons with newly-acquired stroke in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the caregiver experience?<h4>Methods</h4>Recruitment occurred from a single inpatient rehabilitation facility. Participants were administered the Perceived Stress Scale and then completed qualitative semistructured interviews. The investigators used a phenomenological, iterative approach to collect and analyze qualitative data. The data were independently coded and categorized before consolidated into primary themes and subthemes.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven informal caregivers' perspectives generated 13 subthemes across 4 primary thematic categories: COVID-19 impact, concerns of the caregiver, coping strategies, and important aspects of the caregiver experience. COVID-19 social distancing necessitated new visitor policies, which presented additional challenges for caregivers.<h4>Discussion and conclusions</h4>Caregiver attendance at therapy sessions and frequent, direct communication between staff and caregivers improved caregiver readiness for family member discharge following inpatient rehabilitation. This study shared perspectives from a distinctive time during the COVID-19 pandemic. If visitation for multiple therapy sessions is prohibited, we recommend taking alternative measures to keep the caregiver involved in the plan of care.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A326).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33098409,SolupHred: a server to predict the pH-dependent aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Polypeptides are exposed to changing environmental conditions that modulate their intrinsic aggregation propensities. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) constitutively expose their aggregation determinants to the solvent, thus being especially sensitive to its fluctuations. However, solvent conditions are often disregarded in computational aggregation predictors. We recently developed a phenomenological model to predict IDPs' solubility as a function of the solution pH, which is based on the assumption that both protein lipophilicity and charge depend on this parameter. The model anticipated solubility changes in different IDPs accurately. In this application note, we present SolupHred, a web-based interface that implements the aforementioned theoretical framework into a predictive tool able to compute IDPs aggregation propensities as a function of pH. SolupHred is the first dedicated software for the prediction of pH-dependent protein aggregation.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The SolupHred web server is freely available for academic users at: https://ppmclab.pythonanywhere.com/SolupHred.

33407073,SPServer: split-statistical potentials for the analysis of protein structures and protein-protein interactions.,"<h4>Background</h4>Statistical potentials, also named knowledge-based potentials, are scoring functions derived from empirical data that can be used to evaluate the quality of protein folds and protein-protein interaction (PPI) structures. In previous works we decomposed the statistical potentials in different terms, named Split-Statistical Potentials, accounting for the type of amino acid pairs, their hydrophobicity, solvent accessibility and type of secondary structure. These potentials have been successfully used to identify near-native structures in protein structure prediction, rank protein docking poses, and predict PPI binding affinities.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present the SPServer, a web server that applies the Split-Statistical Potentials to analyze protein folds and protein interfaces. SPServer provides global scores as well as residue/residue-pair profiles presented as score plots and maps. This level of detail allows users to: (1) identify potentially problematic regions on protein structures; (2) identify disrupting amino acid pairs in protein interfaces; and (3) compare and analyze the quality of tertiary and quaternary structural models.<h4>Conclusions</h4>While there are many web servers that provide scoring functions to assess the quality of either protein folds or PPI structures, SPServer integrates both aspects in a unique easy-to-use web server. Moreover, the server permits to locally assess the quality of the structures and interfaces at a residue level and provides tools to compare the local assessment between structures.

33416854,GWASinspector: comprehensive quality control of genome-wide association study results.,"<h4>Summary</h4>Quality control (QC) of genome wide association study (GWAS) result files has become increasingly difficult due to advances in genomic technology. The main challenges include continuous increases in the number of polymorphic genetic variants contained in recent GWASs and reference panels, the rising number of cohorts participating in a GWAS consortium, and inclusion of new variant types. Here, we present GWASinspector, a flexible R package for comprehensive QC of GWAS results. This package is compatible with recent imputation reference panels, handles insertion/deletion and multi-allelic variants, provides extensive QC reports and efficiently processes big data files. Reference panels covering three human genome builds (NCBI36, GRCh37 and GRCh38) are available. GWASinspector has a user friendly design and allows easy set-up of the QC pipeline through a configuration file. In addition to checking and reporting on individual files, it can be used in preparation of a meta-analysis by testing for systemic differences between studies and generating cleaned, harmonized GWAS files. Comparison with existing GWAS QC tools shows that the main advantages of GWASinspector are its ability to more effectively deal with insertion/deletion and multi-allelic variants and its relatively low memory use.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our package is available at The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GWASinspector.

33529135,Disruption of the Atrophy-based Functional Network in Multiple Sclerosis Is Associated with Clinical Disability: Validation of a Meta-Analytic Model in Resting-State Functional MRI.,"Background In multiple sclerosis (MS), gray matter (GM) atrophy exhibits a specific pattern, which correlates strongly with clinical disability. However, the mechanism of regional specificity in GM atrophy remains largely unknown. Recently, the network degeneration hypothesis (NDH) was quantitatively defined (using coordinate-based meta-analysis) as the atrophy-based functional network (AFN) model, which posits that localized GM atrophy in MS is mediated by functional networks. Purpose To test the NDH in MS in a data-driven manner using the AFN model to direct analyses in an independent test sample. Materials and Methods Model fit testing was conducted with structural equation modeling, which is based on the computation of semipartial correlations. Model verification was performed in coordinate-based data of healthy control participants from the BrainMap database (<i>https://www.brainmap.org</i>). Model validation was conducted in prospectively acquired resting-state functional MRI in participants with relapsing-remitting MS who were recruited between September 2018 and January 2019. Correlation analyses of model fit indices and volumetric measures with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and disease duration were performed. Results Model verification of healthy control participants included 80‚Äâ194 coordinates from 9035 experiments. Model verification in healthy control data resulted in excellent model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.037; 90% CI: 0.036, 0.039). Twenty participants (mean age, 36 years ¬± 9 [standard deviation]; 12 women) with relapsing-remitting MS were evaluated. Model validation in resting-state functional MRI in participants with MS resulted in deviation from optimal model fit (root mean square error of approximation, 0.071; 90% CI: 0.070, 0.072), which correlated with EDSS scores (<i>r</i> = 0.68; <i>P</i> = .002). Conclusion The atrophy-based functional network model predicts functional network disruption in multiple sclerosis (MS), thereby supporting the network degeneration hypothesis. On resting-state functional MRI scans, reduced functional network integrity in participants with MS had a strong positive correlation with clinical disability. ¬© RSNA, 2021 <i>Online supplemental material is available for this article.</i>","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not descriptive of resource

33622334,Identification of major depressive disorder disease-related genes and functional pathways based on system dynamic changes of network connectivity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading psychiatric disorder that involves complex abnormal biological functions and neural networks. This study aimed to compare the changes in the network connectivity of different brain tissues under different pathological conditions, analyzed the biological pathways and genes that are significantly related to disease progression, and further predicted the potential therapeutic drug targets.<h4>Methods</h4>Expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed with postmortem cingulate cortex (ACC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) mRNA expression profile datasets downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including 76 MDD patients and 76 healthy subjects in ACC and 63 MDD patients and 63 healthy subjects in PFC. The co-expression network construction was based on system network analysis. The function of the genes was annotated by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD, http://www.hprd.org/ ) was used for gene interaction relationship mapping.<h4>Results</h4>We filtered 586 DEGs in ACC and 616 DEGs in PFC for further analysis. By constructing the co-expression network, we found that the gene connectivity was significantly reduced under disease conditions (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.04 in PFC and P‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.227e-09 in ACC). Crosstalk analysis showed that CD19, PTDSS2 and NDST2 were significantly differentially expressed in ACC and PFC of MDD patients. Among them, CD19 and PTDSS2 have been targeted by several drugs in the Drugbank database. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that the function of CD19 and PTDSS2 were enriched with the pathway of Glycerophospholipid metabolism and T cell receptor signaling pathway.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Co-expression network and tissue comparing analysis can identify signaling pathways and cross talk genes related to MDD, which may provide novel insight for understanding the molecular mechanisms of MDD.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not descriptive of resource
33630831,A plasmid DNA-launched SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system and coronavirus toolkit for COVID-19 research.,"The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the underlying cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a worldwide pandemic causing substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic devastation. In response, many laboratories have redirected attention to SARS-CoV-2, meaning there is an urgent need for tools that can be used in laboratories unaccustomed to working with coronaviruses. Here we report a range of tools for SARS-CoV-2 research. First, we describe a facile single plasmid SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system that is simple to genetically manipulate and can be used to rescue infectious virus through transient transfection (without in vitro transcription or additional expression plasmids). The rescue system is accompanied by our panel of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (against nearly every viral protein), SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolates, and SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines, which are all openly available to the scientific community. Using these tools, we demonstrate here that the controversial ORF10 protein is expressed in infected cells. Furthermore, we show that the promising repurposed antiviral activity of apilimod is dependent on TMPRSS2 expression. Altogether, our SARS-CoV-2 toolkit, which can be directly accessed via our website at https://mrcppu-covid.bio/, constitutes a resource with considerable potential to advance COVID-19 vaccine design, drug testing, and discovery science.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

These 40 outcomes were scored for importance in two rounds of an online Delphi survey (n = 79), with 18 people attending the consensus meeting. Consensus was reached on 12 core outcomes: therapeutic misconception; comfort with decision; authenticity of decision; communication about the trial; empowerment; sense of altruism; equipoise; knowledge; salience of questions; understanding, how helpful the process was for decision making; and trial attrition.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The ELICIT core outcome set is the first internationally agreed minimum set of outcomes deemed essential to be measured in all future studies evaluating interventions to improve decisions about participating in an randomized controlled trial. Use of the ELICIT core set will ensure that results from these trials are comparable and relevant to all stakeholders.<h4>Registration</h4>COMET database - http://www.comet-initiative.org/Studies/Details/595.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,out of scope
33840048,Rank-preserving biclustering algorithm: a case study on miRNA breast cancer.,"Effective biomarkers aid in the early diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancer and thus play an important role in the treatment of patients suffering from the disease. Growing evidence indicates that alteration of expression levels of miRNA is one of the principal causes of cancer. We analyze breast cancer miRNA data to discover a list of biclusters as well as breast cancer miRNA biomarkers which can help to understand better this critical disease and take important clinical decisions for treatment and diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a pattern-based parallel biclustering algorithm termed Rank-Preserving Biclustering (RPBic). The key strategy is to identify rank-preserved rows under a subset of columns based on a modified version of all substrings common subsequence (ALCS) framework. To illustrate the effectiveness of the RPBic algorithm, we consider synthetic datasets and show that RPBic outperforms relevant biclustering algorithms in terms of relevance and recovery. For breast cancer data, we identify 68 biclusters and establish that they have strong clinical characteristics among the samples. The differentially co-expressed miRNAs are found to be involved in KEGG cancer related pathways. Moreover, we identify frequency-based biomarkers (hsa-miR-410, hsa-miR-483-5p) and network-based biomarkers (hsa-miR-454, hsa-miR-137) which we validate to have strong connectivity with breast cancer.

33877858,Developing a Flexible National Wastewater Surveillance System for COVID-19 and Beyond.,"<h4>Background</h4>Wastewater testing offers a cost-effective strategy for measuring population disease prevalence and health behaviors. For COVID-19, wastewater surveillance addresses testing gaps and provides an early warning for outbreaks. As U.S. federal agencies build a National Wastewater Surveillance System around the pandemic, thinking through ways to develop flexible frameworks for wastewater sampling, testing, and reporting can avoid unnecessary system overhauls for future infectious disease, chronic disease, and drug epidemics.<h4>Objectives</h4>We discuss ways to transform a historically academic exercise into a tool for epidemic response. We generalize lessons learned by a global network of wastewater researchers around validation and implementation for COVID-19 and opioids while also drawing on our experience with wastewater-based epidemiology in the United States.<h4>Discussion</h4>Sustainable wastewater surveillance requires coordination between health and safety officials, utilities, labs, and researchers. Adapting sampling frequency, type, and location to threat level, community vulnerability, biomarker properties, and decisions that wastewater data will inform can increase the practical value of the data. Marketplace instabilities, coupled with a fragmented testing landscape due to specialization, may require officials to engage multiple labs to test for known and unknown threats. Government funding can stabilize the market, balancing commercial pressures with public good, and incentivize data sharing. When reporting results, standardizing metrics and contextualizing wastewater data with health resource data can provide insights into a community's vulnerability and identify strategies to prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed. If wastewater data will inform policy decisions for an entire community, comparing characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant's service population to those of the larger community can help determine whether the wastewater data are generalizable. Ethical protocols may be needed to protect privacy and avoid stigmatization. With data-driven approaches to sample collection, analysis, and interpretation, officials can use wastewater surveillance for adaptive resource allocation, pandemic management, and program evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33961960,Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DNACPR) decisions in people admitted with suspected COVID-19: Secondary analysis of the PRIEST observational cohort study.,"<h4>Aims</h4>We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of adults admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 according to their DNACPR decisions, and identify factors associated with DNACPR decisions.<h4>Methods</h4>We undertook a secondary analysis of 13,977 adults admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19 and included in the Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage (PRIEST) study. We recorded presenting characteristics and outcomes (death or organ support) up to 30 days. We categorised patients as early DNACPR (before or on the day of admission) or late/no DNACPR (no DNACPR or occurring after the day of admission). We undertook descriptive analysis comparing these groups and multivariable analysis to identify independent predictors of early DNACPR.<h4>Results</h4>We excluded 1249 with missing DNACPR data, and identified 3929/12748 (31%) with an early DNACPR decision. They had higher mortality (40.7% v 13.1%) and lower use of any organ support (11.6% v 15.7%), but received a range of organ support interventions, with some being used at rates comparable to those with late or no DNACPR (e.g. non-invasive ventilation 4.4% v 3.5%). On multivariable analysis, older age (p < 0.001), active malignancy (p < 0.001), chronic lung disease (p < 0.001), limited performance status (p < 0.001), and abnormal physiological variables were associated with increased recording of early DNACPR. Asian ethnicity was associated with reduced recording of early DNACPR (p = 0.001).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Early DNACPR decisions were associated with recognised predictors of adverse outcome, and were inversely associated with Asian ethnicity. Most people with an early DNACPR decision survived to 30 days and many received potentially life-saving interventions.<h4>Registration</h4>ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN28342533, http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN28342533.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Through differential proteomic analysis researchers can shed light on groups of proteins or individual proteins that play key roles in certain, normal or pathological conditions. However, several tools for the analysis of such complex datasets are powerful, but hard-to-use with steep learning curves. In addition, some other tools are easy to use, but are weak in terms of analytical power. Previously, we have introduced ProteoSign, a powerful, yet user-friendly open-source online platform for protein differential expression/abundance analysis designed with the end-proteomics user in mind. Part of Proteosign's power stems from the utilization of the well-established Linear Models For Microarray Data (LIMMA) methodology. Here, we present a substantial upgrade of this computational resource, called ProteoSign v2, where we introduce major improvements, also based on user feedback. The new version offers more plot options, supports additional experimental designs, analyzes updated input datasets and performs a gene enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed proteins.

The data is a result of a research collaboration between the scientist from INRAE, agricultural advisers from Chamber of Agriculture of Pays de la Loire (CRAPL) and a collective of five arable and two livestock farmers located in the district of Pays de Pouzauges (Vend√©e department, western France). All participants formed part of the DiverIMPACTS project (https://www.diverimpacts.net/) that aims to achieve the full potential of diversification of cropping systems for improved productivity, delivery of ecosystem services and resource-efficient and sustainable value chains in Europe. The first dataset corresponds to the inputs of MAELIA (http://maelia-platform.inra.fr/), a spatial agent-based simulation platform that was used to support an iterative design and assessment of scenarios to redesign cropping systems. The second dataset corresponds to the outputs of MAELIA simulations and the associated indicators at the farm, group and territory level. The data comprise multiple shape and csv files characterizing the edaphic-climatic heterogeneity of the territory and cropping systems, farmers' crop management rules (IF-THEN rules) and general information about the farms (e.g. crops, agricultural equipment, average crop yields). Data is reported for the baseline situation and three exchange scenarios containing different innovative cropping systems co-designed by scientists, agricultural advisers and the farmers. The data presented here can be found in the Portail Data INRA repository (https://doi.org/10.15454/3ZTCF5) and were used in the research article ""Fostering local crop-livestock integration via legume exchanges using an innovative integrated assessment and modelling approach: MAELIA"" [1].","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,references other db,

The revolution in high-throughput methods has accumulated massive chromatin accessibility profiles in public repositories. Nevertheless, utilization of these data is hampered by cumbersome collection, time-consuming processing, and manual chromatin accessibility (openness) annotation of genomic regions. To fill this gap, we developed OpenAnnotate (http://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/openannotate/) as the first web server for efficiently annotating openness of massive genomic regions across various biosample types, tissues, and biological systems. In addition to the annotation resource from 2729 comprehensive profiles of 614 biosample types of human and mouse, OpenAnnotate provides user-friendly functionalities, ultra-efficient calculation, real-time browsing, intuitive visualization, and elaborate application notebooks. We show its unique advantages compared to existing databases and toolkits by effectively revealing cell type-specificity, identifying regulatory elements and 3D chromatin contacts, deciphering gene functional relationships, inferring functions of transcription factors, and unprecedentedly promoting single-cell data analyses. We anticipate OpenAnnotate will provide a promising avenue for researchers to construct a more holistic perspective to understand regulatory mechanisms.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,

Estimates represent changes in response to any 1-ng/mL unit increase in exposure.<h4>Results</h4>Multivariable linear regression models yielded 29,049 CpGs that were differentially methylated in relation to increases in cotinine at a 5% false discovery rate. Top CpGs were within or near genes involved in neuronal functioning (<i>PRKG1</i>, <i>DLGAP2</i>, <i>BSG</i>), carcinogenesis (<i>FHIT</i>, <i>HSPC157</i>) and inflammation (<i>AGER</i>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses suggest cotinine was related to methylation of gene pathways controlling neuronal signaling, metabolic regulation, cell signaling and regulation, and cancer. Further, enhancers associated with transcription start sites were enriched in altered CpGs. Using an independent sample from the same study population (n=115), bisulfite pyrosequencing was performed with infant cord blood DNA for two genes within our top 20 hits (<i>AGER</i> and <i>PRKG1</i>). Results from pyrosequencing replicated epigenome results for <i>PRKG1</i> (cg17079497, estimate=-1.09, standard error‚Äâ(SE)=0.45, p=0.018) but not for AGER (cg09199225; estimate=-0.16, SE=0.21, p=0.44).<h4>Discussion</h4>Secondhand smoke exposure among nonsmoking women may alter DNA methylation in regions involved in development, carcinogenesis, and neuronal functioning. These novel findings suggest that even low levels of smoke exposure during pregnancy may be sufficient to alter DNA methylation in distinct sites of mixed umbilical cord blood leukocytes in pathways that are known to be altered in cord blood from pregnant active smokers. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8099.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34023895,LigAdvisor: a versatile and user-friendly web-platform for drug design.,"Although several tools facilitating in silico drug design are available, their results are usually difficult to integrate with publicly available information or require further processing to be fully exploited. The rational design of multi-target ligands (polypharmacology) and the repositioning of known drugs towards unmet therapeutic needs (drug repurposing) have raised increasing attention in drug discovery, although they usually require careful planning of tailored drug design strategies. Computational tools and data-driven approaches can help to reveal novel valuable opportunities in these contexts, as they enable to efficiently mine publicly available chemical, biological, clinical, and disease-related data. Based on these premises, we developed LigAdvisor, a data-driven webserver which integrates information reported in DrugBank, Protein Data Bank, UniProt, Clinical Trials and Therapeutic Target Database into an intuitive platform, to facilitate drug discovery tasks as drug repurposing, polypharmacology, target fishing and profiling. As designed, LigAdvisor enables easy integration of similarity estimation results with clinical data, thereby allowing a more efficient exploitation of information in different drug discovery contexts. Users can also develop customizable drug design tasks on their own molecules, by means of ligand- and target-based search modes, and download their results.

34038112,CyProduct: A Software Tool for Accurately Predicting the Byproducts of Human Cytochrome P450 Metabolism.,"<i>In silico</i> metabolism prediction is a cheminformatic task of autonomously predicting the set of metabolic byproducts produced from a specified molecule and a set of enzymes or reactions. Here, we describe a novel machine learned <i>in silico</i> cytochrome P450 (CYP450) metabolism prediction suite, called CyProduct, that accurately predicts metabolic byproducts for a specified molecule and a human CYP450 isoform. It includes three modules: (1) CypReact, a tool that predicts if the query compound reacts with a given CYP450 enzyme, (2) CypBoM, a tool that accurately predicts the ""bond site"" of the reaction (i.e., which specific bonds within the query molecule react with the CYP isoform), and (3) MetaboGen, a tool that generates the metabolic byproducts based on CypBoM's bond-site prediction. CyProduct predicts metabolic biotransformation products for each of the nine most important human CYP450 enzymes. CypBoM uses an important new concept called ""bond of metabolism"" (BoM), which extends the traditional ""site of metabolism"" (SoM) by specifying the information about the set of chemical <i>bonds</i> that is modified or formed in a metabolic reaction (rather than the specific atom). We created a BoM database for 1845 CYP450-mediated Phase I reactions, then used this to train the CypBoM Predictor to predict the reactive bond locations on substrate molecules. CypBoM Predictor's cross-validated Jaccard score for reactive bond prediction ranged from 0.380 to 0.452 over the nine CYP450 enzymes. Over variants of a test set of 68 known CYP450 substrates and 30 nonreactants, CyProduct outperformed the other packages, including ADMET Predictor, BioTransformer, and GLORY, by an average of 200% (with respect to Jaccard score) in terms of predicting metabolites.

34122523,Development and Validation of a Hypoxia-Related Signature for Predicting Survival Outcomes in Patients With Bladder Cancer.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to develop and validate a hypoxia signature for predicting survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded the RNA sequence and the clinicopathologic data of the patients with bladder cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) databases. Hypoxia genes were retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). Differentially expressed hypoxia-related genes were screened by univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso regression analysis. Then, the selected genes constituted the hypoxia signature and were included in multivariate Cox regression to generate the risk scores. After that, we evaluate the predictive performance of this signature by multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The CIBERSORT tool was applied to investigate the relationship between the hypoxia signature and the immune cell infiltration, and the maftool was used to summarize and analyze the mutational data. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the related signaling pathways of differentially expressed genes in both risk groups. Furthermore, we developed a model and presented it with a nomogram to predict survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Results</h4>Eight genes (AKAP12, ALDOB, CASP6, DTNA, HS3ST1, JUN, KDELR3, and STC1) were included in the hypoxia signature. The patients with higher risk scores showed worse overall survival time than the ones with lower risk scores in the training set (TCGA) and two external validation sets (GSE13507 and GSE32548). Immune infiltration analysis showed that two types of immune cells (M0 and M1 macrophages) had a significant infiltration in the high-risk group. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) analysis showed that the risk scores between the wild types and the mutation types of TP53, MUC16, RB1, and FGFR3 were significantly different. Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that immune or cancer-associated pathways belonged to the high-risk groups and metabolism-related signal pathways were enriched into the low-risk group. Finally, we constructed a predictive model with risk score, age, and stage and validated its performance in GEO datasets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We successfully constructed and validated a novel hypoxia signature in bladder cancer, which could accurately predict patients' prognosis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
34133393,Evaluation of Bowel Function after Surgical Treatment for Intestinal Endometriosis: A Prospective Study.,"<h4>Background</h4>Defecation symptoms related to intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis are considered to be caused by anatomical and functional disorders, and are likely linked to the course of the disease and surgical treatment.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary aim of this study was to assess bowel function before and after intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis surgery. Secondarily, we sought to correlate defecatory symptoms with preoperative risk factors.<h4>Design/settings</h4>This is a single center prospective cohort study, using the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score to evaluate bowel function 4 weeks before, as well as at 6 months and one year after surgery. Wilcoxon signed rank test and logistic multiple regression analyses were performed to compare preoperative and postoperative scores. For all of the comparisons, the level of significance was set at <0.05.<h4>Patients</h4>Thirty-seven adult female patients who underwent intestinal resection for deep infiltrative endometriosis between 2015 and 2017 were included.<h4>Main outcome measures</h4>The primary outcome was bowel function appraisement in deep infiltrative endometriosis intestinal surgery.<h4>Results</h4>During the preoperative evaluation, 48.6% of patients reported Low Anterior Resection Syndrome Score ‚â•21. This group presented a mean score of 17.9 ¬± 13.7, with a median of 20 and a range of 5 - 30. After one year, the mean score was decreased to 9.6 ¬± 11.1, with a median of 4 and a range of 0 - 22. A significant difference was detected when comparing the post- and preoperative scores (p=0.0006). It was also reported improvements in defecatory symptoms such as reduced fecal incontinence for flatus (p= 0.004) and liquid stools (p=0.014). The clustering of stools (p=0.005) and fecal urgency (p=0.001) also improved one year after surgery. The preoperative multiple logistic regression showed that dyschezia was the only independent variable associated with bowel symptoms.<h4>Limitations</h4>Despite it is a well-documented prospective study the data presented has a relatively small population.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study provides evidence that intestinal deep infiltrative endometriosis surgery improves bowel function and has a positive impact on evacuation symptoms.

34164647,DUI: the drug use insights web server.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Substance abuse constitutes one of the major contemporary health epidemics. Recently, the use of social media platforms has garnered interest as a novel source of data for drug addiction epidemiology. Often however, the language used in such forums comprises slang and jargon. Currently, there are no publicly available resources to automatically analyse the esoteric language-use in the social media drug-use sub-culture. This lacunae introduces critical challenges for interpreting, sensemaking and modeling of addiction epidemiology using social media.<h4>Results</h4>Drug-Use Insights (DUI) is a public and open-source web application to address the aforementioned deficiency. DUI is underlined by a hierarchical taxonomy encompassing 108 different addiction related categories consisting of over 9,000 terms, where each category encompasses a set of semantically related terms. These categories and terms were established by utilizing thematic analysis in conjunction with term embeddings generated from 7,472,545 Reddit posts made by 1,402,017 redditors. Given post(s) from social media forums such as Reddit and Twitter, DUI can be used foremost to identify constituent terms related to drug use. Furthermore, the DUI categories and integrated visualization tools can be leveraged for semantic- and exploratory analysis. To the best of our knowledge, DUI utilizes the largest number of substance use and recovery social media posts used in a study and represents the first significant online taxonomy of drug abuse terminology.<h4>Availability</h4>The DUI web server and source code are available at: http://haddock9.sfsu.edu/insight/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Training and testing were conducted with a 75:25 breakdown. Area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were used to compare different CNN models' performances in classifying TM images.<h4>Results</h4>Our database included 400 images, organized into normal (n‚Ää=‚Ää196) and abnormal classes (n‚Ää=‚Ää204), including acute otitis media (n‚Ää=‚Ää116), otitis externa (n‚Ää=‚Ää44), chronic suppurative otitis media (n‚Ää=‚Ää23), and cerumen impaction (n‚Ää=‚Ää21). For binary classification between normal versus abnormal TM, the best performing model had average AUC-ROC of 0.902 (MobileNetV2), followed by 0.745 (Inception-Resnet-V2), 0.731 (ResNet-50), and 0.636 (Inception-V3). Accuracy ranged between 0.73-0.77, sensitivity 0.72-0.88, specificity 0.58-0.84, PPV 0.68-0.81, and NPV 0.73-0.83. Macro-AUC-ROC for MobileNetV2 based multiclass-classifier was 0.91, with accuracy of 66%. Binary and multiclass-classifier models based on MobileNetV2 were loaded onto a publicly accessible and user-friendly website (https://headneckml.com/tympanic). This allows the readership to upload TM images for real-time predictions using the developed algorithms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Novel CNN algorithms were developed with high AUC-ROCs for differentiating between various TM pathologies. This was further deployed as a proof-of-concept publicly accessible website for real-time predictions.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,software,out of scope

The rapidly changing landscape of proteomics software makes finding a tool fit for a particular purpose a significant challenge. The comparison of software and the selection of tools capable to perform a certain operation on a given type of data rely on their detailed annotation using well-defined descriptors. However, finding accurate information including tool input/output capabilities can be challenging and often heavily depends on manual curation efforts. This is further hampered by a rather low half-life of most of the tools, thus demanding the maintenance of a resource with updated information about the tools. We present here our approach to curate a collection of 189 software tools with detailed information about their functional capabilities.

32436932,miRactDB characterizes miRNA-gene relation switch between normal and cancer tissues across pan-cancer.,"It has been increasingly accepted that microRNA (miRNA) can both activate and suppress gene expression, directly or indirectly, under particular circumstances. Yet, a systematic study on the switch in their interaction pattern between activation and suppression and between normal and cancer conditions based on multi-omics evidences is not available. We built miRactDB, a database for miRNA-gene interaction, at https://ccsm.uth.edu/miRactDB, to provide a versatile resource and platform for annotation and interpretation of miRNA-gene relations. We conducted a comprehensive investigation on miRNA-gene interactions and their biological implications across tissue types in both tumour and normal conditions, based on TCGA, CCLE and GTEx databases. We particularly explored the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms potentially contributing to the positive correlation, including identification of miRNA binding sites in the gene coding sequence (CDS) and promoter regions of partner genes. Integrative analysis based on this resource revealed that top-ranked genes derived from TCGA tumour and adjacent normal samples share an overwhelming part of biological processes, which are quite different than those from CCLE and GTEx. The most active miRNAs predicted to target CDS and promoter regions are largely overlapped. These findings corroborate that adjacent normal tissues might have undergone significant molecular transformations towards oncogenesis before phenotypic and histological change; and there probably exists a small yet critical set of miRNAs that profoundly influence various cancer hallmark processes. miRactDB provides a unique resource for the cancer and genomics communities to screen, prioritize and rationalize their candidates of miRNA-gene interactions, in both normal and cancer scenarios.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Yet, much of these biological data is still isolated in the text, figures, tables and supplementary materials of articles. As a result, biological information created at great expense is significantly underutilised. The protein motif biology field does not have sufficient resources to curate the corpus of motif-related literature and, to date, only a fraction of the available articles have been curated. In this study, we develop a set of tools and a web resource, 'articles.ELM', to rapidly identify the motif literature articles pertinent to a researcher's interest. At the core of the resource is a manually curated set of about 8000 motif-related articles. These articles are automatically annotated with a range of relevant biological data allowing in-depth search functionality. Machine-learning article classification is used to group articles based on their similarity to manually curated motif classes in the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource. Articles can also be manually classified within the resource. The 'articles.ELM' resource permits the rapid and accurate discovery of relevant motif articles thereby improving the visibility of motif literature and simplifying the recovery of valuable biological insights sequestered within scientific articles.

32639365,A transcriptional toolbox for exploring peripheral neuroimmune interactions.,"<h4>Abstract</h4>Correct communication between immune cells and peripheral neurons is crucial for the protection of our bodies. Its breakdown is observed in many common, often painful conditions, including arthritis, neuropathies, and inflammatory bowel or bladder disease. Here, we have characterised the immune response in a mouse model of neuropathic pain using flow cytometry and cell-type-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found few striking sex differences, but a very persistent inflammatory response, with increased numbers of monocytes and macrophages up to 3 1/2 months after the initial injury. This raises the question of whether the commonly used categorisation of pain into ""inflammatory"" and ""neuropathic"" is one that is mechanistically appropriate. Finally, we collated our data with other published RNA-seq data sets on neurons, macrophages, and Schwann cells in naive and nerve injury states. The result is a practical web-based tool for the transcriptional data mining of peripheral neuroimmune interactions. http://rna-seq-browser.herokuapp.com/.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,essentailly a knoweldgebase - all data can be downloaded in excel format

33175872,High density genotype storage for plant breeding in the Chado schema of Breedbase.,"Modern breeding programs routinely use genome-wide information for selecting individuals to advance. The large volumes of genotypic information required present a challenge for data storage and query efficiency. Major use cases require genotyping data to be linked with trait phenotyping data. In contrast to phenotyping data that are often stored in relational database schemas, next-generation genotyping data are traditionally stored in non-relational storage systems due to their extremely large scope. This study presents a novel data model implemented in Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) for uniting relational phenotyping data and non-relational genotyping data within the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Breedbase is an open-source, web-database designed to manage all of a breeder's informatics needs: management of field experiments, phenotypic and genotypic data collection and storage, and statistical analyses. The genotyping data is stored in a PostgreSQL data-type known as binary JavaScript Object Notation (JSONb), where the JSON structures closely follow the Variant Call Format (VCF) data model. The Breedbase genotyping data model can handle different ploidy levels, structural variants, and any genotype encoded in VCF.

Among these associations, protein-protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user's query data.

With the rapid progress on high-throughput sequencing technologies and the reduction of sequencing cost, large-scale genomic data of a specific crop have become available. However, raw sequence data are mostly deposited in the sequence read archive of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), which is freely accessible to all researchers. Extensive tools for practical purposes should be developed to efficiently utilize these large raw data. Here, we report a web-based rapeseed genomic variation database (BnaGVD, http://rapeseed.biocloud.net/home) from which genomic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (InDels) across a world-wide collection of rapeseed accessions, can be referred. The current release of the BnaGVD contains 34,591,899 high-quality SNPs and 12,281,923 high-quality InDels and provides search tools to retrieve genomic variations and gene annotations across 1,007 accessions of worldwide rapeseed germplasm.

Proteins of unknown function (PUFs) are interesting targets for GM crops breeding pipelines for the novelty associated with such targets and also to avoid copyright protection. One method of inferring the putative function of PUFs is by relating them to factors of interest such as abiotic stresses using orthology and co-expression networks, in a guilt-by-association manner. In this regard, we have downloaded, analyzed, and processed genomics data of 53 angiosperms, totaling 1,862,010 genes and 2,332,974 RNA. Diamond and InterproScan were used to discover 72,266 PUFs for all organisms. RNA-seq datasets related to abiotic stresses were downloaded from NCBI/GEO. The RNA-seq data was used as input to the LSTrAP software to construct co-expression networks. LSTrAP also created clusters of transcripts with correlated expression, whose members are more probably related to the molecular mechanisms associated with abiotic stresses in the plants. Orthologous groups were created (OrhtoMCL) using all 2,332,974 proteins in order to associate PUFs to abiotic stress-related clusters of co-expression and therefore infer their function in a guilt-by-association manner. A freely available web resource named ""Plant Co-expression Annotation Resource"" ( https://www.machado.cnptia.embrapa.br/plantannot ), Plantannot, was created to provide indexed queries to search for PUF putatively associated with abiotic stresses. The web interface also allows browsing, querying, and retrieving of public genomics data from 53 plants. We hope Plantannot to be useful for researchers trying to obtain novel GM crops resistant to climate change hazards.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,value add

The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the availability of DNA testing for hereditary diseases and genetic predispositions in dogs and cats utilizing the WSAVA-PennGen DNA Testing Database web resource (URL: http://research.vet.upenn.edu/WSAVA-LabSearch ). Information on hereditary diseases, DNA tests, genetic testing laboratories and afflicted breeds added to the web-based WSAVA-PennGen DNA Testing Database was gathered. Following verification through original research and clinical studies, searching various databases on hereditary diseases in dogs and cats, and contacting laboratories offering DNA tests, the data were compared to the resource reported on in 2013. The number of molecularly defined Mendelian inherited diseases and variants in companion animals listed in the WSAVA-PennGen DNA Testing Database in 2020 drastically increased by 112% and 141%, respectively. The number of DNA variant tests offered by each laboratory has also doubled for dogs and cats. While the overall number of laboratories has only slightly increased from 43 to 47, the number of larger corporate laboratories increased, while academic laboratories have declined. In addition, there are now several laboratories that are offering breed-specific or all-breed panel tests rather than single-DNA tests for dogs and cats. This unique regularly updated searchable web-based database allows veterinary clinicians, breeders and pet owners to readily find available DNA tests, laboratories performing these DNA tests worldwide, and canine and feline breeds afflicted and also serves as a valuable resource for comparative geneticists.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

The biomarker has become a significant topic due to its versatile usage in the medical field and in rapid detection of the presence or severity of some diseases. The volume of biomarker data is rapidly increasing and the identified data are scattered. To provide comprehensive information, the explosively growing data need to be recorded in a single platform. There is no open-source freely available comprehensive online biomarker database. To fulfill this purpose, we have developed a human biomarker database as part of the KNApSAcK family databases which contain a vast quantity of information on the relationships between biomarkers and diseases. We have classified the diseases into 18 disease classes, mostly according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information definitions. Apart from this database development, we also have performed disease classification by separately using protein and metabolite biomarkers based on the network clustering algorithm DPClusO and hierarchical clustering. Finally, we reached a conclusion about the relationships among the disease classes. The human biomarker database can be accessed online and the inter-disease relationships may be helpful in understanding the molecular mechanisms of diseases.

The goal of PhenX is to facilitate the use of standard measures, enhance data interoperability, and promote collaborative and translational research. PhenX is driven by the scientific community and historically has depended on working groups of experts to recommend measures for release in the PhenX Toolkit. The urgent need for recommended, standard measures for COVID-19 research triggered the development of a ""rapid release"" process for releasing new content in the PhenX Toolkit. Initially, PhenX collaborated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the NIH Disaster Research Response (DR2) program to create a library of COVID-19 measurement protocols. With additional support from NIH, PhenX adapted crowdsourcing techniques to accelerate prioritization and recommendation of protocols for release in the PhenX Toolkit. Prioritized COVID-19-specific protocols were used to anchor and define specialty collections of protocols that were subject to review and approval by the PhenX Steering Committee. In addition to the COVID-19-specific protocols, the specialty collections include existing, well-established PhenX protocols, use of which will further enhance data interoperability and cross-study analysis. The COVID-19 specialty collections are Behaviors and Risks; Ethnicity, Race and Demographics; History, Treatment and Outcomes; Information Resources; Psychosocial and Mental Health; and Socioeconomic.

33942874,Human IRES Atlas: an integrative platform for studying IRES-driven translational regulation in humans.,"It is now known that cap-independent translation initiation facilitated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) is vital in selective cellular protein synthesis under stress and different physiological conditions. However, three problems make it hard to understand transcriptome-wide cellular IRES-mediated translation initiation mechanisms: (i) complex interplay between IRESs and other translation initiation-related information, (ii) reliability issue of in silico cellular IRES investigation and (iii) labor-intensive in vivo IRES identification. In this research, we constructed the Human IRES Atlas database for a comprehensive understanding of cellular IRESs in humans. First, currently available and suitable IRES prediction tools (IRESfinder, PatSearch and IRESpy) were used to obtain transcriptome-wide human IRESs. Then, we collected eight genres of translation initiation-related features to help study the potential molecular mechanisms of each of the putative IRESs. Three functional tests (conservation, structural RNA-protein scores and conditional translation efficiency) were devised to evaluate the functionality of the identified putative IRESs. Moreover, an easy-to-use interface and an IRES-translation initiation interaction map for each gene transcript were implemented to help understand the interactions between IRESs and translation initiation-related features. Researchers can easily search/browse an IRES of interest using the web interface and deduce testable mechanism hypotheses of human IRES-driven translation initiation based on the integrated results. In summary, Human IRES Atlas integrates putative IRES elements and translation initiation-related experiments for better usage of these data and deduction of mechanism hypotheses.

34020544,Ori-Finder 3: a web server for genome-wide prediction of replication origins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.,"DNA replication is a fundamental process in all organisms; this event initiates at sites termed origins of replication. The characteristics of eukaryotic replication origins are best understood in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For this species, origin prediction algorithms or web servers have been developed based on the sequence features of autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs). However, their performances are far from satisfactory. By utilizing the Z-curve methodology, we present a novel pipeline, Ori-Finder 3, for the computational prediction of replication origins in S. cerevisiae at the genome-wide level based solely on DNA sequences. The ARS exhibiting both an AT-rich stretch and ARS consensus sequence element can be predicted at the single-nucleotide level. For the identified ARSs in the S. cerevisiae reference genome, 83 and 60% of the top 100 and top 300 predictions matched the known ARS records, respectively. Based on Ori-Finder 3, we subsequently built a database of the predicted ARSs identified in more than a hundred S. cerevisiae genomes. Consequently, we developed a user-friendly web server including the ARS prediction pipeline and the predicted ARSs database, which can be freely accessed at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/Ori-Finder3.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

The identification of suitable biomarkers could facilitate early detection and diagnosis and allow better understanding of the underlying pathology. One of the challenges in meeting this goal is the necessary integration of experimental results from multiple biological levels for further analysis by data mining. Data integration in the life science is still a struggle, and many groups are looking to the benefits promised by the Semantic Web for data integration.<h4>Results</h4>We present a Semantic Web approach to developing a knowledge base that integrates data from high-throughput experiments on kidney and urine. A specialised KUP ontology is used to tie the various layers together, whilst background knowledge from external databases is incorporated by conversion into RDF. Using SPARQL as a query mechanism, we are able to query for proteins expressed in urine and place these back into the context of genes expressed in regions of the kidney.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The KUPKB gives KUP biologists the means to ask queries across many resources in order to aggregate knowledge that is necessary for answering biological questions. The Semantic Web technologies we use, together with the background knowledge from the domain's ontologies, allows both rapid conversion and integration of this knowledge base. The KUPKB is still relatively small, but questions remain about scalability, maintenance and availability of the knowledge itself.<h4>Availability</h4>The KUPKB may be accessed via http://www.e-lico.eu/kupkb.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,read this
22139934,Cube-DB: detection of functional divergence in human protein families.,"Cube-DB is a database of pre-evaluated results for detection of functional divergence in human/vertebrate protein families. The analysis is organized around the nomenclature associated with the human proteins, but based on all currently available vertebrate genomes. Using full genomes enables us, through a mutual-best-hit strategy, to construct comparable taxonomical samples for all paralogues under consideration. Functional specialization is scored on the residue level according to two models of behavior after divergence: heterotachy and homotachy. In the first case, the positions on the protein sequence are scored highly if they are conserved in the reference group of orthologs, and overlap poorly with the residue type choice in the paralogs groups (such positions will also be termed functional determinants). The second model additionally requires conservation within each group of paralogs (functional discriminants). The scoring functions are phylogeny independent, but sensitive to the residue type similarity. The results are presented as a table of per-residue scores, and mapped onto related structure (when available) via browser-embedded visualization tool. They can also be downloaded as a spreadsheet table, and sessions for two additional molecular visualization tools.

The visual representation of the annotations provided by APPRIS for each gene allows annotators and researchers alike to easily identify functional changes brought about by splicing events. In addition to collecting, integrating and analyzing reliable predictions of the effect of splicing events, APPRIS also selects a single reference sequence for each gene, here termed the principal isoform, based on the annotations of structure, function and conservation for each transcript. APPRIS identifies a principal isoform for 85% of the protein-coding genes in the GENCODE 7 release for ENSEMBL.

A substantial fraction of piRNAs originates from genomic loci termed piRNA clusters and sequences encoded in these piRNA clusters determine putative targets for the Piwi/piRNA system. In the past decade, studies of piRNA transcriptomes in different species revealed additional roles for piRNAs beyond transposon silencing, reflecting the astonishing plasticity of the Piwi/piRNA system along different phylogenetic branches. Moreover, piRNA transcriptomes can change drastically during development and vary across different tissues.Since piRNA clusters crucially shape piRNA profiles, analysis of these loci is imperative for a thorough understanding of functional and evolutionary aspects of the piRNA pathway. But despite the ever-growing amount of available piRNA sequence data, we know little about the factors that determine differential regulation of piRNA clusters, nor the evolutionary events that cause their gain or loss.In order to facilitate addressing these subjects, we established a user-friendly piRNA cluster database (http://www.smallrnagroup-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB.html) that provides comprehensive data on piRNA clusters in multiple species, tissues and developmental stages based on small RNA sequence data deposited at NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA).","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

27188311,A comprehensive database of high-throughput sequencing-based RNA secondary structure probing data (Structure Surfer).,"<h4>Background</h4>RNA molecules fold into complex three-dimensional shapes, guided by the pattern of hydrogen bonding between nucleotides. This pattern of base pairing, known as RNA secondary structure, is critical to their cellular function. Recently several diverse methods have been developed to assay RNA secondary structure on a transcriptome-wide scale using high-throughput sequencing. Each approach has its own strengths and caveats, however there is no widely available tool for visualizing and comparing the results from these varied methods.<h4>Methods</h4>To address this, we have developed Structure Surfer, a database and visualization tool for inspecting RNA secondary structure in six transcriptome-wide data sets from human and mouse ( http://tesla.pcbi.upenn.edu/strucuturesurfer/ ). The data sets were generated using four different high-throughput sequencing based methods. Each one was analyzed with a scoring pipeline specific to its experimental design. Users of Structure Surfer have the ability to query individual loci as well as detect trends across multiple sites.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we describe the included data sets and their differences. We illustrate the database's function by examining known structural elements and we explore example use cases in which combined data is used to detect structural trends.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In total, Structure Surfer provides an easy-to-use database and visualization interface for allowing users to interrogate the currently available transcriptome-wide RNA secondary structure information for mammals.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
27484196,iLIR database: A web resource for LIR motif-containing proteins in eukaryotes.,"Atg8-family proteins are the best-studied proteins of the core autophagic machinery. They are essential for the elongation and closure of the phagophore into a proper autophagosome. Moreover, Atg8-family proteins are associated with the phagophore from the initiation of the autophagic process to, or just prior to, the fusion between autophagosomes with lysosomes. In addition to their implication in autophagosome biogenesis, they are crucial for selective autophagy through their ability to interact with selective autophagy receptor proteins necessary for the specific targeting of substrates for autophagic degradation. In the past few years it has been revealed that Atg8-interacting proteins include not only receptors but also components of the core autophagic machinery, proteins associated with vesicles and their transport, and specific proteins that are selectively degraded by autophagy. Atg8-interacting proteins contain a short linear LC3-interacting region/LC3 recognition sequence/Atg8-interacting motif (LIR/LRS/AIM) motif which is responsible for their interaction with Atg8-family proteins. These proteins are referred to as LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs). So far, many experimental efforts have been carried out to identify new LIRCPs, leading to the characterization of some of them in the past 10�years. Given the need for the identification of LIRCPs in various organisms, we developed the iLIR database ( https://ilir.warwick.ac.uk ) as a freely available web resource, listing all the putative canonical LIRCPs identified in silico in the proteomes of 8 model organisms using the iLIR server, combined with a Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis. Additionally, a curated text-mining analysis of the literature permitted us to identify novel putative LICRPs in mammals that have not previously been associated with autophagy.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,value add and available
27794041,NGSmethDB 2017: enhanced methylomes and differential methylation.,"The 2017 update of NGSmethDB stores whole genome methylomes generated from short-read data sets obtained by bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) technology. To generate high-quality methylomes, stringent quality controls were integrated with third-part software, adding also a two-step mapping process to exploit the advantages of the new genome assembly models. The samples were all profiled under constant parameter settings, thus enabling comparative downstream analyses. Besides a significant increase in the number of samples, NGSmethDB now includes two additional data-types, which are a valuable resource for the discovery of methylation epigenetic biomarkers: (i) differentially methylated single-cytosines; and (ii) methylation segments (i.e. genome regions of homogeneous methylation). The NGSmethDB back-end is now based on MongoDB, a NoSQL hierarchical database using JSON-formatted documents and dynamic schemas, thus accelerating sample comparative analyses. Besides conventional database dumps, track hubs were implemented, which improved database access, visualization in genome browsers and comparative analyses to third-part annotations. In addition, the database can be also accessed through a RESTful API. Lastly, a Python client and a multiplatform virtual machine allow for program-driven access from user desktop. This way, private methylation data can be compared to NGSmethDB without the need to upload them to public servers. Database website: http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/NGSmethDB.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

28539606,SesameFG: an integrated database for the functional genomics of sesame.,"Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) has high oil content, a small diploid genome and a short growth period, making it an attractive species for genetic studies on oilseed crops. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology, genomics and functional genomics research of sesame has developed quickly in the last few years, and large amounts of data have been generated. However, these results are distributed in many different publications, and there is a lack of integration. To promote functional genomics research of sesame, we collected genetic information combined with comprehensive phenotypic information and integrated them in the web-based database named SesameFG. The current version of SesameFG contains phenotypic information on agronomic traits of 705 sesame accessions, de novo assembled genomes of three sesame varieties, massive numbers of identified SNPs, gene expression profiles of five tissues, gene families, candidate genes for the important agronomic traits and genomic-SSR markers. All phenotypic and genotypic information in SesameFG is available for online queries and can be downloaded freely. SesameFG provides useful search functions and data mining tools, including Genome Browser and local BLAST services. SesameFG is freely accessible at http://ncgr.ac.cn/SesameFG/.

28985416,EVLncRNAs: a manually curated database for long non-coding RNAs validated by low-throughput experiments.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important functional roles in various biological processes. Early databases were utilized to deposit all lncRNA candidates produced by high-throughput experimental and/or computational techniques to facilitate classification, assessment and validation. As more lncRNAs are validated by low-throughput experiments, several databases were established for experimentally validated lncRNAs. However, these databases are small in scale (with a few hundreds of lncRNAs only) and specific in their focuses (plants, diseases or interactions). Thus, it is highly desirable to have a comprehensive dataset for experimentally validated lncRNAs as a central repository for all of their structures, functions and phenotypes. Here, we established EVLncRNAs by curating lncRNAs validated by low-throughput experiments (up to 1 May 2016) and integrating specific databases (lncRNAdb, LncRANDisease, Lnc2Cancer and PLNIncRBase) with additional functional and disease-specific information not covered previously. The current version of EVLncRNAs contains 1543 lncRNAs from 77 species that is 2.9 times larger than the current largest database for experimentally validated lncRNAs. Seventy-four percent lncRNA entries are partially or completely new, comparing to all existing experimentally validated databases. The established database allows users to browse, search and download as well as to submit experimentally validated lncRNAs.

29059366,SBCDDB: Sleeping Beauty Cancer Driver Database for gene discovery in mouse models of human cancers.,"Large-scale oncogenomic studies have identified few frequently mutated cancer drivers and hundreds of infrequently mutated drivers. Defining the biological context for rare driving events is fundamentally important to increasing our understanding of the druggable pathways in cancer. Sleeping Beauty (SB) insertional mutagenesis is a powerful gene discovery tool used to model human cancers in mice. Our lab and others have published a number of studies that identify cancer drivers from these models using various statistical and computational approaches. Here, we have integrated SB data from primary tumor models into an analysis and reporting framework, the Sleeping Beauty Cancer Driver DataBase (SBCDDB, http://sbcddb.moffitt.org), which identifies drivers in individual tumors or tumor populations. Unique to this effort, the SBCDDB utilizes a single, scalable, statistical analysis method that enables data to be grouped by different biological properties. This allows for SB drivers to be evaluated (and re-evaluated) under different contexts. The SBCDDB provides visual representations highlighting the spatial attributes of transposon mutagenesis and couples this functionality with analysis of gene sets, enabling users to interrogate relationships between drivers. The SBCDDB is a powerful resource for comparative oncogenomic analyses with human cancer genomics datasets for driver prioritization.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

Reactome functions both as an archive of biological processes and as a tool for discovering unexpected functional relationships in data such as gene expression profiles or somatic mutation catalogues from tumor cells. To support the continued brisk growth in the size and complexity of Reactome, we have implemented a graph database, improved performance of data analysis tools, and designed new data structures and strategies to boost diagram viewer performance. To make our website more accessible to human users, we have improved pathway display and navigation by implementing interactive Enhanced High Level Diagrams (EHLDs) with an associated icon library, and subpathway highlighting and zooming, in a simplified and reorganized web site with adaptive design. To encourage re-use of our content, we have enabled export of pathway diagrams as 'PowerPoint' files.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
29315358,HTT-DB: new features and updates.,"Horizontal Transfer (HT) of genetic material between species is a common phenomenon among Bacteria and Archaea species and several databases are available for information retrieval and data mining. However, little attention has been given to this phenomenon among eukaryotic species mainly due to the lower proportion of these events. In the last years, a vertiginous amount of new HT events involving eukaryotic species was reported in the literature, highlighting the need of a common repository to keep the scientific community up to date and describe overall trends. Recently, we published the first HT database focused on HT of transposable elements among eukaryotes: the Horizontal Transposon Transfer DataBase (http://lpa.saogabriel.unipampa.edu.br: 8080/httdatabase/). Here, we present new features and updates of this unique database: (i) its expansion to include virus-host exchange of genetic material, which we called Horizontal Virus Transfer (HVT) and (ii) the availability of a web server for HT detection, where we implemented the online version of vertical and horizontal inheritance consistence analysis (VHICA), an R package developed for HT detection. These improvements will help researchers to navigate through known HVT cases, take data-informed decision and export figures based on keywords searches. Moreover, the availability of the VHICA as an online tool will make this software easily reachable even for researchers with no or little computation knowledge as well as foster our capability to detect new HT events in a wide variety of taxa.

APID Interactomes is a public resource of biological data (http://apid.dep.usal.es) that provides a comprehensive and curated collection of `protein interactomes' for more than 1100 organisms, including 30 species with more than 500 interactions, derived from the integration of experimentally detected protein-to-protein physical interactions (PPIs). We have performed an update of APID database including a redefinition of several key properties of the PPIs to provide a more precise data integration and to avoid false duplicated records. This includes the unification of all the PPIs from five primary databases of molecular interactions (BioGRID, DIP, HPRD, IntAct and MINT), plus the information from two original systematic sources of human data and from experimentally resolved 3D structures (i.e. PDBs, Protein Data Bank files, where more than two distinct proteins have been identified). Thus, APID provides PPIs reported in published research articles (with traceable PMIDs) and detected by valid experimental interaction methods that give evidences about such protein interactions (following the `ontology and controlled vocabulary': www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi; developed by `HUPO PSI-MI'). Within this data mining framework, all interaction detection methods have been grouped into two main types: (i) `binary' physical direct detection methods and (ii) `indirect' methods. As a result of these redefinitions, APID provides unified protein interactomes including the specific `experimental evidences' that support each PPI, indicating whether the interactions can be considered `binary' (i.e. supported by at least one binary detection method) or not.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,

These transcript isoforms are now known to be expressed in a variety of organisms across the kingdoms of life. Recent studies have shown the role of circRNAs in a number of diseases and increasing evidence points to their potential application as biomarkers in these diseases. We have created a comprehensive manually curated database of circular RNAs associated with diseases. This database is available at URL http://clingen.igib.res.in/circad/. The Database lists more than 1300 circRNAs associated with 150 diseases and mapping to 113 International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes with evidence of association linked to published literature. The database is unique in many ways. Firstly, it provides ready-to-use primers to work with, in order to use circRNAs as biomarkers or to perform functional studies. It additionally lists the assay and PCR primer details including experimentally validated ones as a ready reference to researchers along with fold change and statistical significance. It also provides standard disease nomenclature as per the ICD codes.

32277449,Choice of the Promoter for Tissue and Developmental Stage-Specific Gene Expression.,"Transgenic technologies belong to important tools of reverse genetics and biotechnology in plants. Targeted genetic modifications can reveal functions of genes of interest, change metabolic and regulatory pathways, or result in accumulation of valuable proteins or metabolites. However, to be efficient in targeted genetic modification, the chimeric gene construct should be designed properly. In particular, the promoters used to control transgene expression need to be carefully chosen. Most promoters in widely used vectors belong to strong and constitutively expressed variants. However, in many cases transgene expression has to be restricted to certain tissue, stage of development, or response to some internal or external stimuli. In turn, a large variety of tissue-specific promoters have been studied and information on their characteristics may be recovered from the literature. An appropriate promoter may be selected and used in genetic construct to optimize the transgene transcription pattern. We have previously designed the TGP database (TransGene Promoters, http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/dbases/tgp/home.html ) collecting information from the publications in this field. Here we review the wide range of noncanonical tissue-specific and developmentally regulated promoters that might be used for transgene expression control.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,iffy
33008298,Database: web application for visualization of the cumulated RNAseq data against the salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana.,"<h4>Background</h4>Plants have adapted to survive under adverse conditions or exploit favorable conditions in response to their environment as sessile creatures. In a way of plant adaptation, plant hormones have been evolved to efficiently use limited resources. Plant hormones including auxin, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene have been studied to reveal their role in plant adaptation against their environment by phenotypic observation with experimental design such as mutation on hormone receptors and treatment / non-treatment of plant hormones along with other environmental conditions. With the development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology, it became possible to score the total gene expression of the sampled plants and estimate the degree of effect of plant hormones in gene expression. This allowed us to infer the signaling pathway through plant hormones, which greatly stimulated the study of functional genomics using mutants. Due to the continued development of NGS technology and analytical techniques, many plant hormone-related studies have produced and accumulated NGS-based data, especially RNAseq data have been stored in the sequence read archive represented by NCBI, EBI, and DDBJ.<h4>Description</h4>Here, hormone treatment RNAseq data of Arabidopsis (Col0), wild-type genotype, were collected with mock, SA, and MeJA treatments. The genes affected by hormones were identified through a machine learning approach. The degree of expression of the affected gene was quantified, visualized in boxplot using d3 (data-driven-document), and the database was built by Django.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Using this database, we created a web application ( http://pgl.gnu.ac.kr/hormoneDB/ ) that lists hormone-related or hormone-affected genes and visualizes the boxplot of the gene expression of selected genes. This web application eventually aids the functional genomics researchers who want to gather the cases of the gene responses by the hormones.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,,
IND601142821,MulSatDB: a first online database for mulberry microsatellites,"KEY MESSAGE : Simple sequence repeat motifs were mined from the genome and EST sequences of Morus notabilis and archived in MulSatDB. Bioinformatics tools were integrated with the database for the analysis of genomic datasets. Mulberry is a crop of economic importance in sericulture, which shapes the lives of millions of rural people among different Eurasian and Latin American countries. Limited availability of genomic resources has constrained the molecular breeding efforts in mulberry, a poorly studied crop. Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) has revolutionized the plant breeding and is used in linkage mapping, association studies, diversity, and parentage analysis, etc. Recent availability of mulberry whole genome assembly provided an opportunity for the development of mulberry-specific DNA markers. In this study, we mined a total of 217,312 microsatellites from whole genome and 961 microsatellites from EST sequences of Morus notabilis. Mono-repeats were predominant among both whole genome and EST sequences. The SSR containing EST sequences were functionally annotated, and SSRs mined from whole genome were mapped on chromosomes of the phylogenetically related genus�Fragaria vesca, to aid the selection of markers based on the function and location. All the mined markers were archived in the mulberry microsatellite database (MulSatDB), and the markers can be retrieved based on different criteria like marker location, repeat kind, motif type and size. Primer3plus and CMap tools are integrated with the database to design primers for PCR amplification and to visualize markers on F. vesca chromosomes, respectively. A blast tool is also integrated to collate new markers with the database.

21643562,Toxicity tests aiming to protect Brazilian aquatic systems: current status and implications for management.,"The current status of toxicological tests performed with Brazilian native species was evaluated through a survey of the scientific data available in the literature. The information gathered was processed and an electronic toxicology database (http://www.inct-ta.furg.br/bd_toxicologico.php) was generated. This database provides valuable information for researchers to select sensitive and tolerant aquatic species to a large variety of aquatic pollutants. Furthermore, the toxicology database allows researchers to select species representative of an ecosystem of interest. Analysis of the toxicology database showed that ecotoxicological assays have significantly improved in Brazil over the last decade, in spite of the still relatively low number of tests performed and the restricted number of native species tested. This is because most of the research is developed in a few laboratories concentrated in certain regions of Brazil, especially in Southern and Southeast regions. Considering the extremely rich biodiversity and the large variety of aquatic ecosystems in Brazil, this finding points to the urgent need for the development of ecotoxicological studies with other groups of aquatic animals, such as insects, foraminifera, cnidarians, worms, amphibians, among others. This would help to derive more realistic water quality criteria (WQC) values, which would better protect the different aquatic ecosystems in Brazil. Finally, the toxicology database generated presents solid and science based information, which can encourage and drive the Environmental Regulatory Agencies in Brazil to derive WQC based on native species. In this context, the present paper discusses the historical evolution of ecotoxicological studies in Brazil, and how they have contributed to the improvement of the Brazilian Federal and Regional regulations for environment.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource

However, site-specific mapping of the selectivity and dynamics of these redox reactions in cells poses a major analytical challenge. Here we describe a chemoproteomic platform to systematically and quantitatively analyze the reactivity of thousands of cysteines toward H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in human cells. We identified >900 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive cysteines, which are defined as the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent redoxome. Although redox sites associated with antioxidative and metabolic functions are consistent, most of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent redoxome varies dramatically between different cells. Structural analyses reveal that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive cysteines are less conserved than their redox-insensitive counterparts and display distinct sequence motifs, structural features, and potential for crosstalk with lysine modifications. Notably, our chemoproteomic platform also provides an opportunity to predict oxidation-triggered protein conformational changes.

RESULTS:We fused data from 11 databases, and used Na�ve Bayes classifier and positive unlabeled learning (PUL) methods, NB, Spy, and Rocchio-SVM, to rank human genes in respect with their implication in aging. The PUL methods enabled us to identify a list of negative (non-aging) genes to use alongside the seed (known age-related) genes in the ranking process. Comparison of the PUL algorithms revealed that none of the methods for identifying a negative sample were advantageous over other methods, and their simultaneous use in a form of fusion was critical for obtaining optimal results (PPHAGE is publicly available at https://cbb.ut.ac.ir/pphage). CONCLUSION:We predict and prioritize over 3,000 candidate age-related genes in human, based on significant ranking scores. The identified candidate genes are associated with pathways, ontologies, and diseases that are linked to aging, such as cancer and diabetes. Our data offer a platform for future experimental research on the genetic and biological aspects of aging. Additionally, we demonstrate that fusion of PUL methods and data sources can be successfully used for aging and disease candidate gene prioritization.","hji,kes",1,1,2,2,1.0,"no notes; reassessed and yes, includes data resource",no notes; reassessed and still yes - includes a data resource
33737684,"Proteomic blood profiling in mild, severe and critical COVID-19 patients.","The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic manifests itself as a mild respiratory tract infection in most individuals, leading to COVID-19 disease. However, in some infected individuals, this can progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. This study explores the proteomic differences between mild, severe, and critical COVID-19 positive patients to further understand the disease progression, identify proteins associated with disease severity, and identify potential therapeutic targets. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n = 26), severe (n = 9) or critical (n = 24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https://phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/COVID19/ . Our results demonstrate that dynamic changes in blood proteins associated with disease severity can potentially be used as early biomarkers to monitor disease severity in COVID-19 and serve as potential therapeutic targets.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

In particular, subgroups of strongly coexpressed gene pairs result in an increased variance of the correlation distribution. This variance, a measure of association between sets of genes (or proteins), can be summarized as the bimodality of coexpression (BiC). We developed an online tool to calculate the BiC for user-defined gene lists and associated mRNA expression data.

21371586,"Preparation of protein samples for NMR structure, function, and small-molecule screening studies.","In this chapter, we concentrate on the production of high-quality protein samples for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. In particular, we provide an in-depth description of recent advances in the production of NMR samples and their synergistic use with recent advancements in NMR hardware. We describe the protein production platform of the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium and outline our high-throughput strategies for producing high-quality protein samples for NMR studies. Our strategy is based on the cloning, expression, and purification of 6�-His-tagged proteins using T7-based Escherichia coli systems and isotope enrichment in minimal media. We describe 96-well ligation-independent cloning and analytical expression systems, parallel preparative scale fermentation, and high-throughput purification protocols. The 6�-His affinity tag allows for a similar two-step purification procedure implemented in a parallel high-throughput fashion that routinely results in purity levels sufficient for NMR studies (>97% homogeneity). Using this platform, the protein open reading frames of over 17,500 different targeted proteins (or domains) have been cloned as over 28,000 constructs. Nearly 5000 of these proteins have been purified to homogeneity in tens of milligram quantities (see Summary Statistics, http://nesg.org/statistics.html), resulting in more than 950 new protein structures, including more than 400 NMR structures, deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium pipeline has been effective in producing protein samples of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin. Although this chapter describes our entire pipeline for producing isotope-enriched protein samples, it focuses on the major updates introduced during the last 5 years (Phase 2 of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Protein Structure Initiative). Our advanced automated and/or parallel cloning, expression, purification, and biophysical screening technologies are suitable for implementation in a large individual laboratory or by a small group of collaborating investigators for structural biology, functional proteomics, ligand screening, and structural genomics research.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21493653,A robust and accurate binning algorithm for metagenomic sequences with arbitrary species abundance ratio.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>With the rapid development of next-generation sequencing techniques, metagenomics, also known as environmental genomics, has emerged as an exciting research area that enables us to analyze the microbial environment in which we live. An important step for metagenomic data analysis is the identification and taxonomic characterization of DNA fragments (reads or contigs) resulting from sequencing a sample of mixed species. This step is referred to as 'binning'. Binning algorithms that are based on sequence similarity and sequence composition markers rely heavily on the reference genomes of known microorganisms or phylogenetic markers. Due to the limited availability of reference genomes and the bias and low availability of markers, these algorithms may not be applicable in all cases. Unsupervised binning algorithms which can handle fragments from unknown species provide an alternative approach. However, existing unsupervised binning algorithms only work on datasets either with balanced species abundance ratios or rather different abundance ratios, but not both.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we present MetaCluster 3.0, an integrated binning method based on the unsupervised top--down separation and bottom--up merging strategy, which can bin metagenomic fragments of species with very balanced abundance ratios (say 1:1) to very different abundance ratios (e.g. 1:24) with consistently higher accuracy than existing methods.<h4>Availability</h4>MetaCluster 3.0 can be downloaded at http://i.cs.hku.hk/~alse/MetaCluster/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21546400,Mixture models for analysis of the taxonomic composition of metagenomes.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Inferring the taxonomic profile of a microbial community from a large collection of anonymous DNA sequencing reads is a challenging task in metagenomics. Because existing methods for taxonomic profiling of metagenomes are all based on the assignment of fragmentary sequences to phylogenetic categories, the accuracy of results largely depends on fragment length. This dependence complicates comparative analysis of data originating from different sequencing platforms or resulting from different preprocessing pipelines.<h4>Results</h4>We here introduce a new method for taxonomic profiling based on mixture modeling of the overall oligonucleotide distribution of a sample. Our results indicate that the mixture-based profiles compare well with taxonomic profiles obtained with other methods. However, in contrast to the existing methods, our approach shows a nearly constant profiling accuracy across all kinds of read lengths and it operates at an unrivaled speed.<h4>Availability</h4>A platform-independent implementation of the mixture modeling approach is available in terms of a MATLAB/Octave toolbox at http://gobics.de/peter/taxy.

As a result of these developments, the analysis of data has become the bottleneck of proteomics experiment. To provide the proteomics community with a user-friendly platform for comprehensive analysis, inspection and visualization of quantitative proteomics data we developed the Graphical Proteomics Data Explorer (GProX)(1). The program requires no special bioinformatics training, as all functions of GProX are accessible within its graphical user-friendly interface which will be intuitive to most users. Basic features facilitate the uncomplicated management and organization of large data sets and complex experimental setups as well as the inspection and graphical plotting of quantitative data. These are complemented by readily available high-level analysis options such as database querying, clustering based on abundance ratios, feature enrichment tests for e.g. GO terms and pathway analysis tools. A number of plotting options for visualization of quantitative proteomics data is available and most analysis functions in GProX create customizable high quality graphical displays in both vector and bitmap formats. The generic import requirements allow data originating from essentially all mass spectrometry platforms, quantitation strategies and software to be analyzed in the program.

By modeling the patterns of linkage disequilibrium in a reference panel, genotypes not directly measured in the study samples can be imputed and used for GWASs. Since millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms need to be imputed in a GWAS, faster methods for genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction are required.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a program package for parallel computation of genotype imputation and haplotype reconstruction. Our program package, ParaHaplo 3.0, is intended for use in workstation clusters using the Intel Message Passing Interface. We compared the performance of ParaHaplo 3.0 on the Japanese in Tokyo, Japan and Han Chinese in Beijing, and Chinese in the HapMap dataset. A parallel version of ParaHaplo 3.0 can conduct genotype imputation 20 times faster than a non-parallel version of ParaHaplo.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ParaHaplo 3.0 is an invaluable tool for conducting haplotype-based GWASs.

21703007,PlantPhos: using maximal dependence decomposition to identify plant phosphorylation sites with substrate site specificity.,"<h4>Background</h4>Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial regulatory roles in intracellular signal transduction. Due to the difficulty in performing high-throughput mass spectrometry-based experiment, there is a desire to predict phosphorylation sites using computational methods. However, previous studies regarding in silico prediction of plant phosphorylation sites lack the consideration of kinase-specific phosphorylation data. Thus, we are motivated to propose a new method that investigates different substrate specificities in plant phosphorylation sites.<h4>Results</h4>Experimentally verified phosphorylation data were extracted from TAIR9-a protein database containing 3006 phosphorylation data from the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. In an attempt to investigate the various substrate motifs in plant phosphorylation, maximal dependence decomposition (MDD) is employed to cluster a large set of phosphorylation data into subgroups containing significantly conserved motifs. Profile hidden Markov model (HMM) is then applied to learn a predictive model for each subgroup. Cross-validation evaluation on the MDD-clustered HMMs yields an average accuracy of 82.4% for serine, 78.6% for threonine, and 89.0% for tyrosine models. Moreover, independent test results using Arabidopsis thaliana phosphorylation data from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot show that the proposed models are able to correctly predict 81.4% phosphoserine, 77.1% phosphothreonine, and 83.7% phosphotyrosine sites. Interestingly, several MDD-clustered subgroups are observed to have similar amino acid conservation with the substrate motifs of well-known kinases from Phospho.ELM-a database containing kinase-specific phosphorylation data from multiple organisms.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This work presents a novel method for identifying plant phosphorylation sites with various substrate motifs. Based on cross-validation and independent testing, results show that the MDD-clustered models outperform models trained without using MDD. The proposed method has been implemented as a web-based plant phosphorylation prediction tool, PlantPhos http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/PlantPhos/. Additionally, two case studies have been demonstrated to further evaluate the effectiveness of PlantPhos.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
21708002,A mutation degree model for the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements.,"<h4>Background</h4>Current approaches for identifying transcriptional regulatory elements are mainly via the combination of two properties, the evolutionary conservation and the overrepresentation of functional elements in the promoters of co-regulated genes. Despite the development of many motif detection algorithms, the discovery of conserved motifs in a wide range of phylogenetically related promoters is still a challenge, especially for the short motifs embedded in distantly related gene promoters or very closely related promoters, or in the situation that there are not enough orthologous genes available.<h4>Results</h4>A mutation degree model is proposed and a new word counting method is developed for the identification of transcriptional regulatory elements from a set of co-expressed genes. The new method comprises two parts: 1) identifying overrepresented oligo-nucleotides in promoters of co-expressed genes, 2) estimating the conservation of the oligo-nucleotides in promoters of phylogenetically related genes by the mutation degree model. Compared with the performance of other algorithms, our method shows the advantages of low false positive rate and higher specificity, especially the robustness to noisy data. Applying the method to co-expressed gene sets from Arabidopsis, most of known cis-elements were successfully detected. The tool and example are available at http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/lab/soft/ocw/OCW.html.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The mutation degree model proposed in this paper is adapted to phylogenetic data of different qualities, and to a wide range of evolutionary distances. The new word-counting method based on this model has the advantage of better performance in detecting short sequence of cis-elements from co-expressed genes of eukaryotes and is robust to less complete phylogenetic data.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

BamView has been developed to visualize and analyse sequence reads from NGS platforms, which have been aligned to a reference sequence. It is a desktop application for browsing the aligned or mapped reads [Ruffalo, M, LaFramboise, T, Koyut�rk, M. Comparative analysis of algorithms for next-generation sequencing read alignment. Bioinformatics 2011;27:2790-6] at different levels of magnification, from nucleotide level, where the base qualities can be seen, to genome or chromosome level where overall coverage is shown. To enable in-depth investigation of NGS data, various views are provided that can be configured to highlight interesting aspects of the data. Multiple read alignment files can be overlaid to compare results from different experiments, and filters can be applied to facilitate the interpretation of the aligned reads.

22915736,Plant B vitamin pathways and their compartmentation: a guide for the perplexed.,"The B vitamins and the cofactors derived from them are essential for life. B vitamin synthesis in plants is consequently as crucial to plants themselves as it is to humans and animals, whose B vitamin nutrition depends largely on plants. The synthesis and salvage pathways for the seven plant B vitamins are now broadly known, but certain enzymes and many transporters have yet to be identified, and the subcellular locations of various reactions are unclear. Although very substantial, what is not known about plant B vitamin pathways is regrettably difficult to discern from the literature or from biochemical pathway databases. Nor do databases accurately represent all that is known about B vitamin pathways-above all their compartmentation-because the facts are scattered throughout the literature, and thus hard to piece together. These problems (i) deter discoveries because newcomers to B vitamins cannot see which mysteries still need solving; and (ii) impede metabolic reconstruction and modelling of B vitamin pathways because genes for reactions or transport steps are missing. This review therefore takes a fresh approach to capture current knowledge of B vitamin pathways in plants. The synthesis pathways, key salvage routes, and their subcellular compartmentation are surveyed in depth, and encoded in the SEED database (http://pubseed.theseed.org/seedviewer.cgi?page=PlantGateway) for Arabidopsis and maize. The review itself and the encoded pathways specifically identify enigmatic or missing reactions, enzymes, and transporters.

22998891,Patterns of medication initiation in newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus: quality and cost implications.,"Currently, 25 million Americans are known to have diabetes, with an additional 7 million cases believed to be undiagnosed. It is estimated that direct and indirect costs of diabetes top $200 billion. Due to the significant health and financial burdens associated with diabetes, it is imperative that this disease be treated quickly and aggressively. In 2009, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes developed a consensus statement regarding the treatment of type 2 diabetes, citing lifestyle modification and metformin as the preferred first line therapies. In this study, the authors looked at prescription claims data for adults who were newly initiated on oral hypoglycemic monotherapy between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008, to determine if initiation patterns changed over time, to evaluate how well the treatment guidelines were being followed, and to assess the economic consequences of prescribing patterns by drug class for both patients and insurers. The results showed that over the course of the study period the proportion of patients initially treated with metformin increased, whereas those receiving sulfonylureas as first-line therapy decreased. Thiazolidinediones experienced the greatest decrease, falling from 20% to 8%, while prescriptions for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors increase from 0-7%. Over a 6-month period, patients taking metformin or sulfonylureas paid approximately $38 to $40 in co-pays while insurance paid about $77. Patients taking other agents paid approximately $130 in co-pays and insurance paid over $500. The authors concluded that based its cost and safety profile, metformin should be the first line drug therapy for patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

23192052,Hierarchical shrinkage priors and model fitting for high-dimensional generalized linear models.,"Abstract     Genetic and other scientific studies routinely generate very many predictor variables, which can be naturally grouped, with predictors in the same groups being highly correlated. It is desirable to incorporate the hierarchical structure of the predictor variables into generalized linear models for simultaneous variable selection and coefficient estimation. We propose two prior distributions: hierarchical Cauchy and double-exponential distributions, on coefficients in generalized linear models. The hierarchical priors include both variable-specific and group-specific tuning parameters, thereby not only adopting different shrinkage for different coefficients and different groups but also providing a way to pool the information within groups. We fit generalized linear models with the proposed hierarchical priors by incorporating flexible expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms into the standard iteratively weighted least squares as implemented in the general statistical package R. The methods are illustrated with data from an experiment to identify genetic polymorphisms for survival of mice following infection with Listeria monocytogenes. The performance of the proposed procedures is further assessed via simulation studies. The methods are implemented in a freely available R package BhGLM (http://www.ssg.uab.edu/bhglm/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23271269,Inference of gene regulatory networks from genome-wide knockout fitness data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genome-wide fitness is an emerging type of high-throughput biological data generated for individual organisms by creating libraries of knockouts, subjecting them to broad ranges of environmental conditions, and measuring the resulting clone-specific fitnesses. Since fitness is an organism-scale measure of gene regulatory network behaviour, it may offer certain advantages when insights into such phenotypical and functional features are of primary interest over individual gene expression. Previous works have shown that genome-wide fitness data can be used to uncover novel gene regulatory interactions, when compared with results of more conventional gene expression analysis. Yet, to date, few algorithms have been proposed for systematically using genome-wide mutant fitness data for gene regulatory network inference.<h4>Results</h4>In this article, we describe a model and propose an inference algorithm for using fitness data from knockout libraries to identify underlying gene regulatory networks. Unlike most prior methods, the presented approach captures not only structural, but also dynamical and non-linear nature of biomolecular systems involved. A state-space model with non-linear basis is used for dynamically describing gene regulatory networks. Network structure is then elucidated by estimating unknown model parameters. Unscented Kalman filter is used to cope with the non-linearities introduced in the model, which also enables the algorithm to run in on-line mode for practical use. Here, we demonstrate that the algorithm provides satisfying results for both synthetic data as well as empirical measurements of GAL network in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and TyrR-LiuR network in bacteria Shewanella oneidensis.<h4>Availability</h4>MATLAB code and datasets are available to download at http://www.duke.edu/~lw174/Fitness.zip and http://genomics.lbl.gov/supplemental/fitness-bioinf/","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,zip file
23342084,Early growth response 3 (Egr3) is highly over-expressed in non-relapsing prostate cancer but not in relapsing prostate cancer.,"Members of the early growth response (EGR) family of transcription factors play diverse functions in response to many cellular stimuli, including growth, stress, and inflammation. Egr3 has gone relatively unstudied, but here through use of the SPECS (Strategic Partners for the Evaluation of Predictive Signatures of Prostate Cancer) Affymetrix whole genome gene expression database we report that Egr3 mRNA is significantly over-expressed in prostate cancer compared to normal prostate tissue (5-fold). The Human Protein Atlas (http://www.proteinatlas.org), a database of tissue microarrays labeled with antibodies against over 11,000 human proteins, was utilized to quantify Egr3 protein expression in normal prostate and prostate cancer patients. In agreement with the SPECS data, we found that Egr3 protein is significantly increased in prostate cancer. The SPECS database has the benefit of extensive clinical follow up for the prostate cancer patients. Analysis of Egr3 mRNA expression in relation to the relapse status reveals that Egr3 mRNA expression is increased in tumor cells of non-relapsed samples (n = 63) compared to normal prostate cells, but is significantly lower in relapsed samples (n = 38) compared to non-relapse. The observations were confirmed using an independent data set. A list of genes correlating with this unique expression pattern was determined. These Egr3-correlated genes were enriched with Egr binding sites in their promoters. The gene list contains inflammatory genes such as IL-6, IL-8, IL1� and COX-2, which have extensive connections to prostate cancer.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23413437,GalaxyGemini: a web server for protein homo-oligomer structure prediction based on similarity.,"<h4>Summary</h4>A large number of proteins function as homo-oligomers; therefore, predicting homo-oligomeric structure of proteins is of primary importance for understanding protein function at the molecular level. Here, we introduce a web server for prediction of protein homo-oligomer structure. The server takes a protein monomer structure as input and predicts its homo-oligomer structure from oligomer templates selected based on sequence and tertiary/quaternary structure similarity. Using protein model structures as input, the server shows clear improvement over the best methods of CASP9 in predicting oligomeric structures from amino acid sequences.<h4>Availability</h4>http://galaxy.seoklab.org/gemini.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23504016,Genomic reconstruction of the transcriptional regulatory network in Bacillus subtilis.,"The adaptation of microorganisms to their environment is controlled by complex transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), which are still only partially understood even for model species. Genome scale annotation of regulatory features of genes and TRN reconstruction are challenging tasks of microbial genomics. We used the knowledge-driven comparative-genomics approach implemented in the RegPredict Web server to infer TRN in the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and 10 related Bacillales species. For transcription factor (TF) regulons, we combined the available information from the DBTBS database and the literature with bioinformatics tools, allowing inference of TF binding sites (TFBSs), comparative analysis of the genomic context of predicted TFBSs, functional assignment of target genes, and effector prediction. For RNA regulons, we used known RNA regulatory motifs collected in the Rfam database to scan genomes and analyze the genomic context of new RNA sites. The inferred TRN in B. subtilis comprises regulons for 129 TFs and 24 regulatory RNA families. First, we analyzed 66 TF regulons with previously known TFBSs in B. subtilis and projected them to other Bacillales genomes, resulting in refinement of TFBS motifs and identification of novel regulon members. Second, we inferred motifs and described regulons for 28 experimentally studied TFs with previously unknown TFBSs. Third, we discovered novel motifs and reconstructed regulons for 36 previously uncharacterized TFs. The inferred collection of regulons is available in the RegPrecise database (http://regprecise.lbl.gov/) and can be used in genetic experiments, metabolic modeling, and evolutionary analysis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced
23531787,EDGE-pro: Estimated Degree of Gene Expression in Prokaryotic Genomes.,"<h4>Background</h4>The expression levels of bacterial genes can be measured directly using next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, offering much greater sensitivity and accuracy than earlier, microarray-based methods. Most bioinformatics software for estimating levels of gene expression from NGS data has been designed for eukaryotic genomes, with algorithms focusing particularly on detection of splicing patterns. These methods do not perform well on bacterial genomes.<h4>Results</h4>Here we describe the first software system designed explicitly for quantifying the degree of gene expression in bacteria and other prokaryotes. EDGE-pro (Estimated Degree of Gene Expression in PROkaryotes) processes the raw data from an RNA-seq experiment on a bacterial or archaeal species and produces estimates of the expression levels for each gene in these gene-dense genomes.<h4>Software</h4>The EDGE-pro tool is implemented as a pipeline of C++ and Perl programs and is freely available as open-source code at http://www.genomics.jhu.edu/software/EDGE/index.shtml.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23587428,The Th17/Treg balance and the expression of related cytokines in Uygur cervical cancer patients.,"<h4>Background</h4>The fine balance of Th17/Treg is crucial for maintenance of immune homeostasis. The objective of this study was to investigate the balance of Th17/Treg and the expression of related cytokines in Uighur cervical cancer patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Peripheral blood was collected from 65 cases of cervical cancer patients, 42 cases of cervical CIN patients and 40 healthy people. Flow cytometry was used to detect the percentages of T cell subsets, including CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, Treg cells and Th17 cells. ELISA assay was conducted to detect expression levels of TGF-�, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-23 and IFN-<U+03B3>.<h4>Results</h4>There were no significant difference in the levels of CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ among the cervical cancer group, the CIN group and the healthy control group. However, compared with the healthy control group, the percentages of CD4+ CD25+ Treg, CD4+CD25+CD127- Treg, CD4+IL17+ Th17, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+, CD4+CD25- Foxp3+, CD8+CD25+CD127-Treg and CD8+CD25+Foxp3 were significantly higher in the cervical cancer group and the CIN group. Similar results were also found in the Th17/Treg ratio and the related cytokines. There was no significant difference between the cervical cancer group and the CIN group. Additionally, Th17 cell levels were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17. Also, Treg cell levels were positively correlated with TGF-�, IL-10 and IL-6. Contrarily, Treg cell levels and IFN-<U+03B3> were negatively correlated.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our data indicated that the Th17/Treg balance was broken in peripheral blood of cervical cancer patients. Analysis of Th17/Treg balance may have a significant implication in diagnosing cervical cancer.<h4>Virtual slides</h4>The virtual slide for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1813823795931511.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23626918,AnsNGS: An Annotation System to Sequence Variations of Next Generation Sequencing Data for Disease-Related Phenotypes.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in the identification of disease-causing genes provides a promising opportunity in the diagnosis of disease. Beyond the previous efforts for NGS data alignment, variant detection, and visualization, developing a comprehensive annotation system supported by multiple layers of disease phenotype-related databases is essential for deciphering the human genome. To satisfy the impending need to decipher the human genome, it is essential to develop a comprehensive annotation system supported by multiple layers of disease phenotype-related databases.<h4>Methods</h4>AnsNGS (Annotation system of sequence variations for next-generation sequencing data) is a tool for contextualizing variants related to diseases and examining their functional consequences. The AnsNGS integrates a variety of annotation databases to attain multiple levels of annotation.<h4>Results</h4>The AnsNGS assigns biological functions to variants, and provides gene (or disease)-centric queries for finding disease-causing variants. The AnsNGS also connects those genes harbouring variants and the corresponding expression probes for downstream analysis using expression microarrays. Here, we demonstrate its ability to identify disease-related variants in the human genome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The AnsNGS can give a key insight into which of these variants is already known to be involved in a disease-related phenotype or located in or near a known regulatory site. The AnsNGS is available free of charge to academic users and can be obtained from http://snubi.org/software/AnsNGS/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23685432,DRIMust: a web server for discovering rank imbalanced motifs using suffix trees.,"Cellular regulation mechanisms that involve proteins and other active molecules interacting with specific targets often involve the recognition of sequence patterns. Short sequence elements on DNA, RNA and proteins play a central role in mediating such molecular recognition events. Studies that focus on measuring and investigating sequence-based recognition processes make use of statistical and computational tools that support the identification and understanding of sequence motifs. We present a new web application, named DRIMust, freely accessible through the website http://drimust.technion.ac.il for de novo motif discovery services. The DRIMust algorithm is based on the minimum hypergeometric statistical framework and uses suffix trees for an efficient enumeration of motif candidates. DRIMust takes as input ranked lists of sequences in FASTA format and returns motifs that are over-represented at the top of the list, where the determination of the threshold that defines top is data driven. The resulting motifs are presented individually with an accurate P-value indication and as a Position Specific Scoring Matrix. Comparing DRIMust with other state-of-the-art tools demonstrated significant advantage to DRIMust, both in result accuracy and in short running times. Overall, DRIMust is unique in combining efficient search on large ranked lists with rigorous P-value assessment for the detected motifs.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
23812995,Compressive genomics for protein databases.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The exponential growth of protein sequence databases has increasingly made the fundamental question of searching for homologs a computational bottleneck. The amount of unique data, however, is not growing nearly as fast; we can exploit this fact to greatly accelerate homology search. Acceleration of programs in the popular PSI/DELTA-BLAST family of tools will not only speed-up homology search directly but also the huge collection of other current programs that primarily interact with large protein databases via precisely these tools.<h4>Results</h4>We introduce a suite of homology search tools, powered by compressively accelerated protein BLAST (CaBLASTP), which are significantly faster than and comparably accurate with all known state-of-the-art tools, including HHblits, DELTA-BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Further, our tools are implemented in a manner that allows direct substitution into existing analysis pipelines. The key idea is that we introduce a local similarity-based compression scheme that allows us to operate directly on the compressed data. Importantly, CaBLASTP's runtime scales almost linearly in the amount of unique data, as opposed to current BLASTP variants, which scale linearly in the size of the full protein database being searched. Our compressive algorithms will speed-up many tasks, such as protein structure prediction and orthology mapping, which rely heavily on homology search.<h4>Availability</h4>CaBLASTP is available under the GNU Public License at http://cablastp.csail.mit.edu/<h4>Contact</h4>bab@mit.edu.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

However, it remains challenging to extract comprehensive information describing the behaviour of neutrophils from the multi-dimensional data sets acquired with widefield or confocal microscopes. Here, we describe PhagoSight, an open-source software package for the segmentation, tracking and visualisation of migrating phagocytes in three dimensions. The algorithms in PhagoSight extract a large number of measurements that summarise the behaviour of neutrophils, but that could potentially be applied to any moving fluorescent cells. To derive a useful panel of variables quantifying aspects of neutrophil migratory behaviour, and to demonstrate the utility of PhagoSight, we evaluated changes in the volume of migrating neutrophils. Cell volume increased as neutrophils migrated towards the wound region of injured zebrafish. PhagoSight is openly available as MATLAB� m-files under the GNU General Public License.

24479843,Quantitative structure-property relationship modeling: a valuable support in high-throughput screening quality control.,"Evaluation of important pharmacokinetic properties such as hydrophobicity by high-throughput screening (HTS) methods is a major issue in drug discovery. In this paper, we present measurements of the chromatographic hydrophobicity index (CHI) on a subset of the French chemical library Chimioth�que Nationale (CN). The data were used in quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling in order to annotate the CN. An algorithm is proposed to detect problematic molecules with large prediction errors, called outliers. In order to find an explanation for these large discrepancies between predicted and experimental values, these compounds were reanalyzed experimentally. As the first selected outliers indeed had experimental problems, including hydrolysis or sheer absence of expected structure, we herewith propose the use of QSPR as a support tool for quality control of screening data and encourage cooperation between experimental and theoretical teams to improve results.

24700317,Fast alignment-free sequence comparison using spaced-word frequencies.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Alignment-free methods for sequence comparison are increasingly used for genome analysis and phylogeny reconstruction; they circumvent various difficulties of traditional alignment-based approaches. In particular, alignment-free methods are much faster than pairwise or multiple alignments. They are, however, less accurate than methods based on sequence alignment. Most alignment-free approaches work by comparing the word composition of sequences. A well-known problem with these methods is that neighbouring word matches are far from independent.<h4>Results</h4>To reduce the statistical dependency between adjacent word matches, we propose to use 'spaced words', defined by patterns of 'match' and 'don't care' positions, for alignment-free sequence comparison. We describe a fast implementation of this approach using recursive hashing and bit operations, and we show that further improvements can be achieved by using multiple patterns instead of single patterns. To evaluate our approach, we use spaced-word frequencies as a basis for fast phylogeny reconstruction. Using real-world and simulated sequence data, we demonstrate that our multiple-pattern approach produces better phylogenies than approaches relying on contiguous words.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Our program is freely available at http://spaced.gobics.de/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
24737859,"The influence of dynein processivity control, MAPs, and microtubule ends on directional movement of a localising mRNA.","Many cellular constituents travel along microtubules in association with multiple copies of motor proteins. How the activity of these motors is regulated during cargo sorting is poorly understood. In this study, we address this issue using a novel in vitro assay for the motility of localising Drosophila mRNAs bound to native dynein-dynactin complexes. High precision tracking reveals that individual RNPs within a population undergo either diffusive, or highly processive, minus end-directed movements along microtubules. RNA localisation signals stimulate the processive movements, with regulation of dynein-dynactin's activity rather than its total copy number per RNP, responsible for this effect. Our data support a novel mechanism for multi-motor translocation based on the regulation of dynein processivity by discrete cargo-associated features. Studying the in vitro responses of RNPs to microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and microtubule ends provides insights into how an RNA population could navigate the cytoskeletal network and become anchored at its destination in cells.

The goal of this study is to determine whether clinical cross-reactivity can be identified from primary protein sequences in allergy epitopes and food proteins.<h4>Methods</h4>High-throughput analysis was performed by assembling all known allergy epitopes within the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB; http://www.iedb.org) for 5 common species from 5 inhalant allergen subclasses and comparing their protein sequences to each other, as well as to sequences of intact proteins from known cross-reactive foods in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) protein database (http://www.uniprot.org) that have been implicated in OAS. Computational methods were employed to allow for exact matching, gaps, and similar amino acids using multiple algorithms. A phylogenetic tree was created to determine evolutionary relationships between cross-reactive epitopes in OAS.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-three common inhalant allergens had 4429 unique epitopes; the 19 foods implicated in OAS had 9497 protein sequences. The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) algorithm identified interclass and intraclass sequence similarities for the 5 inhalant allergy classes with high similarity for mites, grasses, and trees. Analysis of OAS proteins identified 104 matches to inhalant allergy epitopes that are known to cross-react. The phylogenetic tree displayed relationships that mostly followed organism phylogeny.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Use of primary protein sequences was successful in explaining clinical allergy cross-reactivity. Clinical correlation is needed for use of these epitopes as diagnostic or therapeutic entities for patients with cross-reactive allergic disease.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,not about the resource

25204235,"The 5th National Audit Project (NAP5) on accidental awareness during general anaesthesia: protocol, methods and analysis of data.","Accidental awareness during general anaesthesia with recall is a potentially distressing complication of general anaesthesia that can lead to psychological harm. The 5th National Audit Project was designed to investigate the reported incidence, predisposing factors, causality and impact of accidental awareness. A nationwide network of local co-ordinators across all UK and Irish public hospitals reported all new patient reports of accidental awareness to a central database, using a system of monthly anonymised reporting over a calendar year. The database collected the details of the reported event, anaesthetic and surgical technique, and any sequelae. These reports were categorised into main types by a multidisciplinary panel, using a formalised process of analysis. The main categories of accidental awareness were: certain or probable; possible; during sedation; on or from the intensive care unit; could not be determined; unlikely; drug errors; and statement only. The degree of evidence to support the categorisation was also defined for each report. Patient experience and sequelae were categorised using current tools or modifications of such. The 5th National Audit Project methodology may be used to assess new reports of accidental awareness during general anaesthesia in a standardised manner, especially for the development of an ongoing database of case reporting.

25429060,A bio-inspired computing model for ovarian carcinoma classification and oncogene detection.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths in women in the western world for 2013. In ovarian cancer, benign tumors turn malignant, but the point of transition is difficult to predict and diagnose. The 5-year survival rate of all types of ovarian cancer is 44%, but this can be improved to 92% if the cancer is found and treated before it spreads beyond the ovary. However, only 15% of all ovarian cancers are found at this early stage. Therefore, the ability to automatically identify and diagnose ovarian cancer precisely and efficiently as the tissue changes from benign to invasive is important for clinical treatment and for increasing the cure rate. This study proposes a new ovarian carcinoma classification model using two algorithms: a novel discretization of food sources for an artificial bee colony (DfABC), and a support vector machine (SVM). For the first time in the literature, oncogene detection using this method is also investigated.<h4>Results</h4>A novel bio-inspired computing model and hybrid algorithms combining DfABC and SVM was applied to ovarian carcinoma and oncogene classification. This study used the human ovarian cDNA expression database to collect 41 patient samples and 9600 genes in each pathological stage. Feature selection methods were used to detect and extract 15 notable oncogenes. We then used the DfABC-SVM model to examine these 15 oncogenes, dividing them into eight different classifications according to their gene expressions of various pathological stages. The average accuracyof the eight classification experiments was 94.76%. This research also found some oncogenes that had not been discovered or indicated in previous scientific studies. The main contribution of this research is the proof that these newly discovered oncogenes are highly related to ovarian or other cancers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>http://mht.mis.nchu.edu.tw/moodle/course/view.php?id=7.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Current clinical-pathologic stratification factors do not allow clear identification of these high-risk patients. ColoPrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, http://www.agendia.com) is a gene expression classifier that distinguishes patients with low or high risk of disease relapse.<h4>Methods</h4>ColoPrint was developed using whole-genome expression data and validated in several independent validation cohorts. Stage II patients from these studies were pooled (n = 416), and ColoPrint was compared with clinical risk factors described in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2013 Guidelines for Colon Cancer. Median follow-up was 81 months. Most patients (70%) did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Risk of relapse (ROR) was defined as survival until first event of recurrence or death from cancer.<h4>Results</h4>In the pooled stage II data set, ColoPrint identified 63% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 10%, whereas high-risk patients (37%) had a 5-year ROR of 21%, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.16 (p = .004). This remained significant in a multivariate model that included number of lymph nodes retrieved and microsatellite instability. In the T3 microsatellite-stable subgroup (n = 301), ColoPrint classified 59% of patients as low risk with a 5-year ROR of 9.9%. High-risk patients (31%) had a 22.4% ROR (HR: 2.41; p = .005). In contrast, the NCCN clinical high-risk factors were unable to distinguish high- and low-risk patients (15% vs. 13% ROR; p = .55).<h4>Conclusion</h4>ColoPrint significantly improved prognostic accuracy independent of microsatellite status or clinical variables, facilitating the identification of patients at higher risk who might be considered for additional treatment.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25687422,Mega2: validated data-reformatting for linkage and association analyses.,"BACKGROUND:In a typical study of the genetics of a complex human disease, many different analysis programs are used, to test for linkage and association. This requires extensive and careful data reformatting, as many of these analysis programs use differing input formats. Writing scripts to facilitate this can be tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address these issues, the open source Mega2 data reformatting program provides validated and tested data conversions from several commonly-used input formats to many output formats. RESULTS:Mega2, the Manipulation Environment for Genetic Analysis, facilitates the creation of analysis-ready datasets from data gathered as part of a genetic study. It transparently allows users to process genetic data for family-based or case/control studies accurately and efficiently. In addition to data validation checks, Mega2 provides analysis setup capabilities for a broad choice of commonly-used genetic analysis programs. First released in 2000, Mega2 has recently been significantly improved in a number of ways. We have rewritten it in C++ and have reduced its memory requirements. Mega2 now can read input files in LINKAGE, PLINK, and VCF/BCF formats, as well as its own specialized annotated format. It supports conversion to many commonly-used formats including SOLAR, PLINK, Merlin, Mendel, SimWalk2, Cranefoot, IQLS, FBAT, MORGAN, BEAGLE, Eigenstrat, Structure, and PLINK/SEQ. When controlled by a batch file, Mega2 can be used non-interactively in data reformatting pipelines. Support for genetic data from several other species besides humans has been added. CONCLUSIONS:By providing tested and validated data reformatting, Mega2 facilitates more accurate and extensive analyses of genetic data, avoiding the need to write, debug, and maintain one's own custom data reformatting scripts.

The aim of this study was to explore potential statin-induced effects on global gene expression profiles in primary breast cancer.<h4>Experimental design</h4>This window-of-opportunity phase II trial enrolled 50 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients prescribed atorvastatin (80 mg/day) for 2 weeks presurgically. Pre- and posttreatment tumor samples were analyzed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) to identify differentially expressed genes. Similarly, SAM and gene ontology analyses were applied to gene expression data derived from atorvastatin-treated breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, BT474, SKBR3, and MDAMB231) comparing treated and untreated cells. The Systematic Motif Analysis Retrieval Tool (SMART) was used to identify enriched transcription factor-binding sites. Literature Vector Analysis (LitVAn) identified gene module functionality, and pathway analysis was performed using GeneGo Pathways Software (MetaCore; https://portal.genego.com/).<h4>Results</h4>Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles in paired clinical samples revealed 407 significantly differentially expressed genes (FDR = 0); 32 upregulated and 375 downregulated genes. Restricted filtration (fold change =1.49) resulted in 21 upregulated and 46 downregulated genes. Significantly upregulated genes included DUSP1, RHOB1, GADD45B, and RGS1. Pooled results from gene ontology, LitVAn and SMART analyses identified statin-induced effects on the apoptotic and MAPK pathways among others. Comparative analyses of gene expression profiles in breast cancer cell lines showed significant upregulation of the mevalonate and proapoptotic pathways following atorvastatin treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We report potential statin-induced changes in global tumor gene expression profiles, indicating MAPK pathway inhibition and proapoptotic events.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
25861968,MetaSV: an accurate and integrative structural-variant caller for next generation sequencing.,"<h4>Unlabelled</h4>Structural variations (SVs) are large genomic rearrangements that vary significantly in size, making them challenging to detect with the relatively short reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS). Different SV detection methods have been developed; however, each is limited to specific kinds of SVs with varying accuracy and resolution. Previous works have attempted to combine different methods, but they still suffer from poor accuracy particularly for insertions. We propose MetaSV, an integrated SV caller which leverages multiple orthogonal SV signals for high accuracy and resolution. MetaSV proceeds by merging SVs from multiple tools for all types of SVs. It also analyzes soft-clipped reads from alignment to detect insertions accurately since existing tools underestimate insertion SVs. Local assembly in combination with dynamic programming is used to improve breakpoint resolution. Paired-end and coverage information is used to predict SV genotypes. Using simulation and experimental data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaSV across various SV types and sizes.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Code in Python is at http://bioinform.github.io/metasv/.<h4>Contact</h4>rd@bina.com<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

The specimens were radiographed using a charge-coupled device sensor along with an 11-step aluminum step wedge (1.5-mm incremental steps) and 1-mm-thick tooth cut using five tube voltage/exposure time setups (60 kVp, 0.10/0.08 seconds; 70 kVp, 0.10/0.08/0.06 seconds) at 4 mA and 30 cm. The radiopacity of the specimens was compared with that of the aluminum step wedge and human enamel and dentin using NIH ImageJ software (available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). A linear regression model for the aluminum step wedge was constructed, and the data were analyzed by ANOVA and Duncan post hoc test.<h4>Results</h4>Maxcem Elite (5.142 to 5.441) showed the highest radiopacity of all materials, followed in order by Multilink Speed (3.731 to 3.396) and V-link (2.763 to 3.103). The radiopacity of Panavia F 2.0 (2.025 to 2.429), BisCem (1.825 to 2.218), Clearfil SA Luting (1.692 to 2.145), Duolink (1.707 to 1.993), and RelyX Unicem Clicker (1.586 to 1.979) were between enamel (2.117 to 2.330) and dentin (1.302 to 1.685). The radiopacity of 70 kVp conditions was higher than that of the 60 kVp conditions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The radiopacities of the tested luting materials were greater than those of dentin or aluminum, satisfying the criteria of the International Organization for Standardization, and they differed significantly from each other in the exposure setups.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
25871442,Monitoring matrix metalloproteinase activity at the epidermal-dermal interface by SILAC-iTRAQ-TAILS.,"Secreted proteases act on interstitial tissue secretomes released from multiple cell types. Thus, substrate proteins might be part of higher molecular complexes constituted by many proteins with diverse and potentially unknown cellular origin. In cell culture, these may be reconstituted by mixing native secretomes from different cell types prior to incubation with a test protease. Although current degradomics techniques could identify novel substrate proteins in these complexes, all information on the cellular origin is lost. To address this limitation, we combined iTRAQ-based terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (iTRAQ-TAILS) with SILAC to assign proteins to a specific cell type by MS1- and their cleavage by MS2-based quantification in the same experiment. We demonstrate the power of our newly established workflow by monitoring matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 10 dependent cleavages in mixtures from light-labeled keratinocyte and heavy-labeled fibroblast secretomes. This analysis correctly assigned extracellular matrix components, such as laminins and collagens, to their respective cellular origins and revealed their processing in an MMP10-dependent manner.

26115255,Estimation of the environmental dam-offspring correlation in beef cattle.,"A long standing controversy in animal breeding is related to the strong negative estimates of the direct-maternal genetic correlation obtained when fitting data on maternally influenced traits. In this article, we focused on a model that introduces a new correlation parameter among dam-offspring records. The extant theory allows estimation of the parameter when dams have at most a single offspring. Our goal was to develop an inferential procedure in a more general setting. To do so, we applied a Bayesian approach and we showed that the estimation could be accomplished by introducing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) step embedded into a regular Gibbs sampler program. The procedure was implemented by means of an MCMC algorithm known as the Griddy-Gibbs sampler, and a Fortran 90 library was created to accomplish the task. The computer program is available from http://www.agro.uba.ar/catedras/mg_animal/software/RDBLK. With this tool at hand, we applied the inferential procedure to weaning weight records on beef cattle calves from an Argentinean Hereford herd, and we estimated the marginal distribution of the environmental dam-offspring correlation parameter. The distribution was unimodal and symmetric with a mean value of -0.14 (�0.03) and a 95% high posterior density interval between -0.20 and -0.07, indicating that the model placed a huge mass on negative values of the parameter. Noticeably, the magnitude of the direct-maternal genetic correlation diminished from -0.61 to -0.37 with respect to the standard maternal animal model. This result reinforces the idea that environmental covariances among dam-offspring records may bias the estimate of the direct-maternal genetic correlation.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26204236,MI-PVT: A Tool for Visualizing the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome.,"We have developed the web-based Michigan Proteome Visualization Tool (MI-PVT) to visualize and compare protein expression and isoform-level function across human chromosomes and tissues (http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/mipvt). As proof of principle, we have populated the tool with Human Proteome Map (HPM) data. We were able to observe many biologically interesting features. From the vantage point of our chromosome 17 team, for example, we found more than 300 proteins from chromosome 17 expressed in each of the 30 tissues and cell types studied, with the highest number of expressed proteins being 685 in testis. Comparisons of expression levels across tissues showed low numbers of proteins expressed in esophagus, but esophagus had 12 cytoskeletal proteins coded on chromosome 17 with very high expression (>1000 spectral counts). This customized MI-PVT should be helpful for biologists to browse and study specific proteins and protein data sets across tissues and chromosomes. Users can upload any data of interest in MI-PVT for visualization. Our aim is to integrate extensive mass-spectrometric proteomic data into the tool to facilitate finding chromosome-centric protein expression and correlation across tissues.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
26241356,In the pursuit of a semantic similarity metric based on UMLS annotations for articles in PubMed Central Open Access.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Although full-text articles are provided by the publishers in electronic formats, it remains a challenge to find related work beyond the title and abstract context. Identifying related articles based on their abstract is indeed a good starting point; this process is straightforward and does not consume as many resources as full-text based similarity would require. However, further analyses may require in-depth understanding of the full content. Two articles with highly related abstracts can be substantially different regarding the full content. How similarity differs when considering title-and-abstract versus full-text and which semantic similarity metric provides better results when dealing with full-text articles are the main issues addressed in this manuscript.<h4>Methods</h4>We have benchmarked three similarity metrics - BM25, PMRA, and Cosine, in order to determine which one performs best when using concept-based annotations on full-text documents. We also evaluated variations in similarity values based on title-and-abstract against those relying on full-text. Our test dataset comprises the Genomics track article collection from the 2005 Text Retrieval Conference. Initially, we used an entity recognition software to semantically annotate titles and abstracts as well as full-text with concepts defined in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS�). For each article, we created a document profile, i.e., a set of identified concepts, term frequency, and inverse document frequency; we then applied various similarity metrics to those document profiles. We considered correlation, precision, recall, and F1 in order to determine which similarity metric performs best with concept-based annotations. For those full-text articles available in PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA), we also performed dispersion analyses in order to understand how similarity varies when considering full-text articles.<h4>Results</h4>We have found that the PubMed Related Articles similarity metric is the most suitable for full-text articles annotated with UMLS concepts. For similarity values above 0.8, all metrics exhibited an F1 around 0.2 and a recall around 0.1; BM25 showed the highest precision close to 1; in all cases the concept-based metrics performed better than the word-stem-based one. Our experiments show that similarity values vary when considering only title-and-abstract versus full-text similarity. Therefore, analyses based on full-text become useful when a given research requires going beyond title and abstract, particularly regarding connectivity across articles.<h4>Availability</h4>Visualization available at ljgarcia.github.io/semsim.benchmark/, data available at http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13323.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data available at Zenodo
26626453,Fast dimension reduction and integrative clustering of multi-omics data using low-rank approximation: application to cancer molecular classification.,"<h4>Background</h4>One major goal of large-scale cancer omics study is to identify molecular subtypes for more accurate cancer diagnoses and treatments. To deal with high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data, a promising strategy is to find an effective low-dimensional subspace of the original data and then cluster cancer samples in the reduced subspace. However, due to data-type diversity and big data volume, few methods can integrative and efficiently find the principal low-dimensional manifold of the high-dimensional cancer multi-omics data.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we proposed a novel low-rank approximation based integrative probabilistic model to fast find the shared principal subspace across multiple data types: the convexity of the low-rank regularized likelihood function of the probabilistic model ensures efficient and stable model fitting. Candidate molecular subtypes can be identified by unsupervised clustering hundreds of cancer samples in the reduced low-dimensional subspace. On testing datasets, our method LRAcluster (low-rank approximation based multi-omics data clustering) runs much faster with better clustering performances than the existing method. Then, we applied LRAcluster on large-scale cancer multi-omics data from TCGA. The pan-cancer analysis results show that the cancers of different tissue origins are generally grouped as independent clusters, except squamous-like carcinomas. While the single cancer type analysis suggests that the omics data have different subtyping abilities for different cancer types.<h4>Conclusions</h4>LRAcluster is a very useful method for fast dimension reduction and unsupervised clustering of large-scale multi-omics data.

26672762,CyREST: Turbocharging Cytoscape Access for External Tools via a RESTful API.,"As bioinformatic workflows become increasingly complex and involve multiple specialized tools, so does the difficulty of reliably reproducing those workflows. Cytoscape is a critical workflow component for executing network visualization, analysis, and publishing tasks, but it can be operated only manually via a point-and-click user interface. Consequently, Cytoscape-oriented tasks are laborious and often error prone, especially with multistep protocols involving many networks. In this paper, we present the new cyREST Cytoscape app and accompanying harmonization libraries. Together, they improve workflow reproducibility and researcher productivity by enabling popular languages (e.g., Python and R, JavaScript, and C#) and tools (e.g., IPython/Jupyter Notebook and RStudio) to directly define and query networks, and perform network analysis, layouts and renderings. We describe cyREST's API and overall construction, and present Python- and R-based examples that illustrate how Cytoscape can be integrated into large scale data analysis pipelines. cyREST is available in the Cytoscape app store (http://apps.cytoscape.org) where it has been downloaded over 1900 times since its release in late 2014.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

26833341,Integrative analysis for identifying joint modular patterns of gene-expression and drug-response data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>The underlying relationship between genomic factors and the response of diverse cancer drugs still remains unclear. A number of studies showed that the heterogeneous responses to anticancer treatments of patients were partly associated with their specific changes in gene expression and somatic alterations. The emerging large-scale pharmacogenomic data provide us valuable opportunities to improve existing therapies or to guide early-phase clinical trials of compounds under development. However, how to identify the underlying combinatorial patterns among pharmacogenomics data are still a challenging issue.<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we adopted a sparse network-regularized partial least square (SNPLS) method to identify joint modular patterns using large-scale pairwise gene-expression and drug-response data. We incorporated a molecular network to the (sparse) partial least square model to improve the module accuracy via a network-based penalty. We first demonstrated the effectiveness of SNPLS using a set of simulation data and compared it with two typical methods. Further, we applied it to gene expression profiles for 13 321 genes and pharmacological profiles for 98 anticancer drugs across 641 cancer cell lines consisting of diverse types of human cancers. We identified 20 gene-drug co-modules, each of which consists of 30 cell lines, 137 genes and 2 drugs on average. The majority of identified co-modules have significantly functional implications and coordinated gene-drug associations. The modular analysis here provided us new insights into the molecular mechanisms of how drugs act and suggested new drug targets for therapy of certain types of cancers.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>A matlab package of SNPLS is available at http://page.amss.ac.cn/shihua.zhang/<h4>Contact</h4>: zsh@amss.ac.cn<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

27397138,Dynamic Bayesian Network for Accurate Detection of Peptides from Tandem Mass Spectra.,"A central problem in mass spectrometry analysis involves identifying, for each observed tandem mass spectrum, the corresponding generating peptide. We present a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) toolkit that addresses this problem by using a machine learning approach. At the heart of this toolkit is a DBN for Rapid Identification (DRIP), which can be trained from collections of high-confidence peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). DRIP's score function considers fragment ion matches using Gaussians rather than fixed fragment-ion tolerances and also finds the optimal alignment between the theoretical and observed spectrum by considering all possible alignments, up to a threshold that is controlled using a beam-pruning algorithm. This function not only yields state-of-the art database search accuracy but also can be used to generate features that significantly boost the performance of the Percolator postprocessor. The DRIP software is built upon a general purpose DBN toolkit (GMTK), thereby allowing a wide variety of options for user-specific inference tasks as well as facilitating easy modifications to the DRIP model in future work.

We developed a Korean fracture risk prediction model using clinical risk factors and assessed validity of the final model.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 718,306 Korean men and women aged 50-90 years were followed for 7 years in a national system-based cohort study. In total, 50% of the subjects were assigned randomly to the development dataset and 50% were assigned to the validation dataset. Clinical risk factors for osteoporotic fracture were assessed at the biennial health check. Data on osteoporotic fractures during the follow-up period were identified by ICD-10 codes and the nationwide database of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS).<h4>Results</h4>During the follow-up period, 19,840 osteoporotic fractures were reported (4,889 in men and 14,951 in women) in the development dataset. The assessment tool called the Korean Fracture Risk Score (KFRS) is comprised of a set of nine variables, including age, body mass index, recent fragility fracture, current smoking, high alcohol intake, lack of regular exercise, recent use of oral glucocorticoid, rheumatoid arthritis, and other causes of secondary osteoporosis. The KFRS predicted osteoporotic fractures over the 7 years. This score was validated using an independent dataset. A close relationship with overall fracture rate was observed when we compared the mean predicted scores after applying the KFRS with the observed risks after 7 years within each 10th of predicted risk.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We developed a Korean specific prediction model for osteoporotic fractures. The KFRS was able to predict risk of fracture in the primary population without bone mineral density testing and is therefore suitable for use in both clinical setting and self-assessment.

27559155,Fast-SNP: a fast matrix pre-processing algorithm for efficient loopless flux optimization of metabolic models.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Computation of steady-state flux solutions in large metabolic models is routinely performed using flux balance analysis based on a simple LP (Linear Programming) formulation. A minimal requirement for thermodynamic feasibility of the flux solution is the absence of internal loops, which are enforced using 'loopless constraints'. The resulting loopless flux problem is a substantially harder MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) problem, which is computationally expensive for large metabolic models.<h4>Results</h4>We developed a pre-processing algorithm that significantly reduces the size of the original loopless problem into an easier and equivalent MILP problem. The pre-processing step employs a fast matrix sparsification algorithm-Fast- sparse null-space pursuit (SNP)-inspired by recent results on SNP. By finding a reduced feasible 'loop-law' matrix subject to known directionalities, Fast-SNP considerably improves the computational efficiency in several metabolic models running different loopless optimization problems. Furthermore, analysis of the topology encoded in the reduced loop matrix enabled identification of key directional constraints for the potential permanent elimination of infeasible loops in the underlying model. Overall, Fast-SNP is an effective and simple algorithm for efficient formulation of loop-law constraints, making loopless flux optimization feasible and numerically tractable at large scale.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>Source code for MATLAB including examples is freely available for download at http://www.aibn.uq.edu.au/cssb-resources under Software.

27752427,Possibilities of using the German Federal States' permanent soil monitoring program for the monitoring of potential effects of genetically modified organisms (GMO).,"<h4>Background</h4>In the Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMO) into the environment, a monitoring of potential risks is prescribed after their deliberate release or placing on the market. Experience and data of already existing monitoring networks should be included. The present paper summarizes the major findings of a project funded by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (Nutzungsm�glichkeiten der Boden-Dauerbeobachtung der L�nder f�r das Monitoring der Umweltwirkungen gentechnisch ver�nderter Pflanzen. BfN Skripten, Bonn-Bad Godesberg 369, 2014). The full report in german language can be accessed on http://www.bfn.de�and is available as Additional file 1. The aim of the project was to check if it is possible to use the German permanent soil monitoring program (PSM) for the monitoring of GMO. Soil organism communities are highly diverse and relevant with respect to the sustainability of soil functions. They are exposed to GMO material directly by feeding or indirectly through food chain interactions. Other impacts are possible due to their close association to soil particles.<h4>Results</h4>The PSM program can be considered as representative with regard to different soil types and ecoregions in Germany, but not for all habitat types relevant for soil organisms. Nevertheless, it is suitable as a basic grid for monitoring the potential effects of GMO on soil invertebrates.<h4>Conclusions</h4>PSM sites should be used to derive reference values, i.e. range of abundance and presence of different relevant species of soil organisms. Based on these references, it is possible to derive threshold values to define the limit of acceptable change or impact. Therefore, a minimum set of sites and minimum set of standardized methods are needed, i.e. characterization of each site, sampling of selected soil organism groups, adequate adaptation of methods for the purpose of monitoring of potential effects of GMO. Finally, and probably most demanding, it is needed to develop a harmonized evaluation concept.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28066963,Phenotiki: an open software and hardware platform for affordable and easy image-based phenotyping of rosette-shaped plants.,"Phenotyping is important to understand plant biology, but current solutions are costly, not versatile or are difficult to deploy. To solve this problem, we present Phenotiki, an affordable system for plant phenotyping that, relying on off-the-shelf parts, provides an easy to install and maintain platform, offering an out-of-box experience for a well-established phenotyping need: imaging rosette-shaped plants. The accompanying software (with available source code) processes data originating from our device seamlessly and automatically. Our software relies on machine learning to devise robust algorithms, and includes an automated leaf count obtained from 2D images without the need of depth (3D). Our affordable device (~�200) can be deployed in growth chambers or greenhouse to acquire optical 2D images of approximately up to 60 adult Arabidopsis rosettes concurrently. Data from the device are processed remotely on a workstation or via a cloud application (based on CyVerse). In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept validation experiment on top-view images of 24 Arabidopsis plants in a combination of genotypes that has not been compared previously. Phenotypic analysis with respect to morphology, growth, color and leaf count has not been performed comprehensively before now. We confirm the findings of others on some of the extracted traits, showing that we can phenotype at reduced cost. We also perform extensive validations with external measurements and with higher fidelity equipment, and find no loss in statistical accuracy when we use the affordable setting that we propose.

28453624,Inferring Rates and Length-Distributions of Indels Using Approximate Bayesian Computation.,"The most common evolutionary events at the molecular level are single-base substitutions, as well as insertions and deletions (indels) of short DNA segments. A large body of research has been devoted to develop probabilistic substitution models and to infer their parameters using likelihood and Bayesian approaches. In contrast, relatively little has been done to model indel dynamics, probably due to the difficulty in writing explicit likelihood functions. Here, we contribute to the effort of modeling indel dynamics by presenting SpartaABC, an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach to infer indel parameters from sequence data (either aligned or unaligned). SpartaABC circumvents the need to use an explicit likelihood function by extracting summary statistics from simulated sequences. First, summary statistics are extracted from the input sequence data. Second, SpartaABC samples indel parameters from a prior distribution and uses them to simulate sequences. Third, it computes summary statistics from the simulated sets of sequences. By computing a distance between the summary statistics extracted from the input and each simulation, SpartaABC can provide an approximation to the posterior distribution of indel parameters as well as point estimates. We study the performance of our methodology and show that it provides accurate estimates of indel parameters in simulations. We next demonstrate the utility of SpartaABC by studying the impact of alignment errors on the inference of positive selection.

The detection of chemical cross-links between protein residues can identify intra- and interprotein contact sites or provide physical constraints for molecular modeling of protein structure. Recent innovations in cross-linker design, sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and software tools have significantly improved CL-MS approaches. Although a number of algorithms now exist for the identification of cross-linked peptides from mass spectral data, a dearth of user-friendly analysis tools represent a practical bottleneck to the broad adoption of the approach. To facilitate the analysis of CL-MS data, we developed CLMSVault, a software suite designed to leverage existing CL-MS algorithms and provide intuitive and flexible tools for cross-platform data interpretation. CLMSVault stores and combines complementary information obtained from different cross-linkers and search algorithms. CLMSVault provides filtering, comparison, and visualization tools to support CL-MS analyses and includes a workflow for label-free quantification of cross-linked peptides. An embedded 3D viewer enables the visualization of quantitative data and the mapping of cross-linked sites onto PDB structural models.

The aim of this project was to develop an open access risk assessment and cost-utility analysis web-tool for assessing HIV, HCV and HBV screening options (http://www.isbtweb.org/working-parties/transfusion-transmitted-infectious-diseases/). An analysis for six countries (Brazil, Ghana, the Netherlands, South Africa, Thailand and USA) was conducted.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Four strategies; (1) antibody assays (Abs) for HIV and HCV + HBsAg, (2) antibody assays that include antigens for HIV and HCV (Combo) + HBsAg, (3) NAT in minipools of variable size (MP NAT) and (4) individual donation (ID) NAT can be evaluated using the tool. Country-specific data on donors, donation testing results, recipient outcomes and costs are entered using the online interface. Results obtained include the number infections interdicted using each screening options, and the (incremental and average) cost-utility of the options.<h4>Results</h4>In each of the six countries evaluated, the use of antibody assays is cost effective or even cost saving. NAT has varying cost-utility depending on the setting, and where adopted, the incremental cost-utility exceeds any previously defined or proposed threshold in each country.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The web-tool allows an assessment of infectious units interdicted and value for money of different testing strategies.

28787666,ERas is constitutively expressed in full term placenta of pregnant cows.,"ERas is a new gene recently found in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and localized on the X chromosome. It plays a role in mouse ES cell survival and is constitutively active without any mutations. It was also found to be responsible for the maintenance of quiescence of the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), liver-resident mesenchymal stem cells, the activation of which results in liver fibrosis. This gene was not present in human ES cells. ERas was found to be activated in a significant population of human gastric cancer, where ERAS may play a crucial role in gastric cancer cell survival and metastases to liver via down-regulation of E-cadherin. ERas gene has been found to be expressed both in ES cells and adult tissues of cynomolgus monkey. Cynomolgus ERAS did not promote cell proliferation or induce tumor formation. ERAS was also detected in normal and neoplastic urothelium of the urinary bladder in cattle, where bovine ERAS formed a constitutive complex with platelet derived growth factor � receptor (PDGF�R) resulting in the activation of AKT signaling. Here, molecular and morphological findings of ERAS in the full term placenta of pregnant cows have been investigated for the first time. ERAS was studied by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Alignment of the sequence detects a 100% identity with all transcript variant bovine ERas mRNAs, present in the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Furthermore, ERAS was detected by Western blot and investigated by real time PCR that revealed an amount of ERAS more than ERAS found in normal bovine urothelium but less than ERAS present in the liver. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of ERAS protein both at the level of plasma membrane and in cytoplasm of epithelial cells lining caruncular crypts and in trophoblasts of villi. An evident ERAS immunoreactivity was also seen throughout the chorionic and uterine gland epithelium. Although this is not a functional study and further investigations will be warranted, it is conceivable that ERAS may have pleiotropic effects in the placenta, some of which, like normal urothelial cells, might lead to activation of AKT pathway. We speculate that ERAS may play a key role in cellular processes such as cell differentiation and movement. Accordingly, we believe it may be an important factor involved in trophoblast invasiveness via AKT signaling pathway. Therefore, ERas gene is a functional gene which contributes to homeostasis of bovine placenta.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource

However, the covariate distribution among participants in a validation cohort may differ from that of the population for which the model will be used. Since estimates of predictive model performance depend on the distribution of covariates among the subjects to which it is applied, such differences can cause misleading estimates of model performance in the target population. We propose a method for addressing this problem by weighting the cohort subjects to make their covariate distribution better match that of the target population. Simulations show that the method provides accurate estimates of model performance in the target population, while un-weighted estimates may not. We illustrate the method by applying it to evaluate an ovarian cancer prediction model targeted to US women, using cohort data from participants in the California Teachers Study. The methods can be implemented using open-source code for public use as the R-package RMAP (Risk Model Assessment Package) available at http://stanford.edu/~ggong/rmap/ .","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
28886603,Review of Epidemiological Studies of Drinking-Water Turbidity in Relation to Acute Gastrointestinal Illness.,"<h4>Background</h4>Turbidity has been used as an indicator of microbiological contamination of drinking water in time-series studies attempting to discern the presence of waterborne gastrointestinal illness; however, the utility of turbidity as a proxy exposure measure has been questioned.<h4>Objectives</h4>We conducted a review of epidemiological studies of the association between turbidity of drinking-water supplies and incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI), including a synthesis of the overall weight of evidence. Our goal was to evaluate the potential for causal inference from the studies.<h4>Methods</h4>We identified 14 studies on the topic (distinct by region, time period and/or population). We evaluated each study with regard to modeling approaches, potential biases, and the strength of evidence. We also considered consistencies and differences in the collective results.<h4>Discussion</h4>Positive associations between drinking-water turbidity and AGI incidence were found in different cities and time periods, and with both unfiltered and filtered supplies. There was some evidence for a stronger association at higher turbidity levels. The studies appeared to adequately adjust for confounding. There was fair consistency in the notable lags between turbidity measurement and AGI identification, which fell between 6 and 10 d in many studies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The observed associations suggest a detectable incidence of waterborne AGI from drinking water in the systems and time periods studied. However, some discrepant results indicate that the association may be context specific. Combining turbidity with seasonal and climatic factors, additional water quality measures, and treatment data may enhance predictive modeling in future studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1090.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

28981577,'Multi-omic' data analysis using O-miner.,"Innovations in -omics technologies have driven advances in biomedical research. However, integrating and analysing the large volumes of data generated from different high-throughput -omics technologies remain a significant challenge to basic and clinical scientists without bioinformatics skills or access to bioinformatics support. To address this demand, we have significantly updated our previous O-miner analytical suite, to incorporate several new features and data types to provide an efficient and easy-to-use Web tool for the automated analysis of data from '-omics' technologies. Created from a biologist's perspective, this tool allows for the automated analysis of large and complex transcriptomic, genomic and methylomic data sets, together with biological/clinical information, to identify significantly altered pathways and prioritize novel biomarkers/targets for biological validation. Our resource can be used to analyse both in-house data and the huge amount of publicly available information from array and sequencing platforms. Multiple data sets can be easily combined, allowing for meta-analyses. Here, we describe the analytical pipelines currently available in O-miner and present examples of use to demonstrate its utility and relevance in maximizing research output.

29168754,A Bioinformatic Pipeline for Monitoring of the Mutational Stability of Viral Drug Targets with Deep-Sequencing Technology.,"The efficient development of antiviral drugs, including efficient antiviral small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), requires continuous monitoring of the strict correspondence between a drug and the related highly variable viral DNA/RNA target(s). Deep sequencing is able to provide an assessment of both the general target conservation and the frequency of particular mutations in the different target sites. The aim of this study was to develop a reliable bioinformatic pipeline for the analysis of millions of short, deep sequencing reads corresponding to selected highly variable viral sequences that are drug target(s). The suggested bioinformatic pipeline combines the available programs and the ad hoc scripts based on an original algorithm of the search for the conserved targets in the deep sequencing data. We also present the statistical criteria for the threshold of reliable mutation detection and for the assessment of variations between corresponding data sets. These criteria are robust against the possible sequencing errors in the reads. As an example, the bioinformatic pipeline is applied to the study of the conservation of RNA interference (RNAi) targets in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) subtype A. The developed pipeline is freely available to download at the website http://virmut.eimb.ru/.

29224730,A validated calculator to estimate risk of cesarean after an induction of labor with an unfavorable cervix.,"<h4>Background</h4>Induction of labor occurs in >20% of pregnancies, which equates to approximately 1 million women undergoing an induction in the United States annually. Regardless of how common inductions are, our ability to predict induction success is limited. Although multiple risk factors for a failed induction have been identified, risk factors alone are not enough to quantify an actual risk of cesarean for an individual woman undergoing a cesarean.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of this study was to derive and validate a prediction model for cesarean after induction with an unfavorable cervix and to create a Web-based calculator to assist in patient counseling.<h4>Study design</h4>Derivation and validation of a prediction model for cesarean delivery after induction was performed as part of a planned secondary analysis of a large randomized trial. A predictive model for cesarean delivery was derived using multivariable logistic regression from a large randomized trial on induction methods (n�= 491) that took place from 2013 through 2015 at an academic institution. Full-term (=37 weeks) women carrying a singleton gestation with intact membranes and an unfavorable cervix (Bishop score =6 and dilation =2 cm) undergoing an induction were included in this trial. Both nulliparous and multiparous women were included. Women with a prior cesarean were excluded. Refinement of the prediction model was performed using an observational cohort of women from the same institution who underwent an induction (n�= 364) during the trial period. An external validation was performed utilizing a publicly available database (Consortium for Safe Labor) that includes information for >200,000 deliveries from 19 hospitals across the United States from 2002 through 2008. After applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria utilized in the derivation cohort, a total of 8466 women remained for analysis. The discriminative power of each model was assessed using a bootstrap, bias-corrected area under the curve.<h4>Results</h4>The cesarean delivery rates in the derivation and external validation groups were: 27.7% (n�= 136/491) and 26.4% (n�= 2235/8466). In multivariable modeling, nulliparity, gestation age =40 weeks, body mass index at delivery, modified Bishop score, and height were significantly associated with cesarean. A nomogram and calculator were created and found to have an area under the curve in the external validation cohort of 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.74).<h4>Conclusion</h4>A nomogram and user-friendly Web-based calculator that incorporates 5 variables known at the start of induction has been developed and validated. It can be found at: http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/obgyn/labor-induction-calculator/. This calculator can be used to augment patient counseling for women undergoing an induction with an unfavorable cervix.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

In the present study, we aimed to analyse the effects of polyphenolic extracts from five types of Arctic berries in a model of diet-induced obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>Male C57BL/6�J mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HFHS) diet and orally treated with extracts of bog blueberry (BBE), cloudberry (CLE), crowberry (CRE), alpine bearberry (ABE), lingonberry (LGE) or vehicle (HFHS) for 8�weeks. An additional group of standard-chow-fed, vehicle-treated mice was included as a reference control for diet-induced obesity. OGTTs and insulin tolerance tests were conducted, and both plasma insulin and C-peptide were assessed throughout the OGTT. Quantitative PCR, western blot analysis and ELISAs were used to assess enterohepatic immunometabolic features. Faecal DNA was extracted and 16S rRNA gene-based analysis was used to profile the gut microbiota.<h4>Results</h4>Treatment with CLE, ABE and LGE, but not with BBE or CRE, prevented both fasting hyperinsulinaemia (mean � SEM [pmol/l]: chow 67.2 � 12.3, HFHS 153.9 � 19.3, BBE 114.4 � 14.3, CLE 82.5 � 13.0, CRE 152.3 � 24.4, ABE 90.6 � 18.0, LGE 95.4 � 10.5) and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia (mean � SEM AUC [pmol/l � min]: chow 14.3 � 1.4, HFHS 31.4 � 3.1, BBE 27.2 � 4.0, CLE 17.7 � 2.2, CRE 32.6 � 6.3, ABE 22.7 � 18.0, LGE 23.9 � 2.5). None of the berry extracts affected C-peptide levels or body weight gain. Levels of hepatic serine phosphorylated Akt were 1.6-, 1.5- and 1.2-fold higher with CLE, ABE and LGE treatment, respectively, and hepatic carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was 0.6-, 0.7- and 0.9-fold increased in these mice vs vehicle-treated, HFHS-fed mice. These changes were associated with reduced liver triacylglycerol deposition, lower circulating endotoxins, alleviated hepatic and intestinal inflammation, and major gut microbial alterations (e.g. bloom of Akkermansia muciniphila, Turicibacter and Oscillibacter) in CLE-, ABE- and LGE-treated mice.<h4>Conclusions/interpretation</h4>Our findings reveal novel mechanisms by which polyphenolic extracts from ABE, LGE and especially CLE target the gut-liver axis to protect diet-induced obese mice against metabolic endotoxaemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, which importantly improves hepatic insulin clearance. These results support the potential benefits of these Arctic berries and their integration into health programmes to help attenuate obesity-related chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders.<h4>Data availability</h4>All raw sequences have been deposited in the public European Nucleotide Archive server under accession number PRJEB19783 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB19783 ).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,deposited data
29297283,R3D-BLAST2: an improved search tool for similar RNA 3D substructures.,"BACKGROUND:RNA molecules have been known to play a variety of significant roles in cells. In principle, the functions of RNAs are largely determined by their three-dimensional (3D) structures. As more and more RNA 3D structures are available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a bioinformatics tool, which is able to rapidly and accurately search the PDB database for similar RNA 3D structures or substructures, is helpful to understand the structural and functional relationships of RNAs. RESULTS:Since its first release in 2011, R3D-BLAST has become a useful tool for searching the PDB database for similar RNA 3D structures and substructures. It was implemented by a structural-alphabet (SA)-based method, which utilizes an SA with 23 structural letters to encode RNA 3D structures into one-dimensional (1D) structural sequences and applies BLAST to the resulting structural sequences for searching similar substructures of RNAs. In this study, we have upgraded R3D-BLAST to develop a new web server named R3D-BLAST2 based on a higher quality SA newly constructed from a representative and sufficiently non-redundant list of RNA 3D structures. In addition, we have modified the kernel program in R3D-BLAST2 so that it can accept an RNA structure in the mmCIF format as an input. The results of our experiments on a benchmark dataset have demonstrated that R3D-BLAST2 indeed performs very well in comparison to its earlier version R3D-BLAST and other similar tools RNA FRABASE, FASTR3D and RAG-3D by searching a larger number of RNA 3D substructures resembling those of the input RNA. CONCLUSIONS:R3D-BLAST2 is a valuable BLAST-like search tool that can more accurately scan the PDB database for similar RNA 3D substructures.

29309632,Congress of Neurological Surgeons Systematic Review and Evidence-Based Guidelines on Surgical Resection for the Treatment of Patients With Vestibular Schwannomas.,"QUESTION 1:What surgical approaches for vestibular schwannomas (VS) are best for complete resection and facial nerve (FN) preservation when serviceable hearing is present? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the middle fossa (MF) or the retrosigmoid (RS) approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is present. QUESTION 2:Which surgical approach (RS or translabyrinthine [TL]) for VS is best for complete resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support the superiority of either the RS or the TL approach for complete VS resection and FN preservation when serviceable hearing is not present. QUESTION 3:Does VS size matter for facial and vestibulocochlear nerve preservation with surgical resection? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Patients with larger VS tumor size should be counseled about the greater than average risk of loss of serviceable hearing. QUESTION 4:Should small intracanalicular tumors (<1.5 cm) be surgically resected? RECOMMENDATION:There are insufficient data to support a firm recommendation that surgery be the primary treatment for this subclass of VSs. QUESTION 5:Is hearing preservation routinely possible with VS surgical resection when serviceable hearing is present? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Hearing preservation surgery via the MF or the RS approach may be attempted in patients with small tumor size (<1.5 cm) and good preoperative hearing. QUESTION 6:When should surgical resection be the initial treatment in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence that surgical resection should be the initial treatment in patients with NF2. QUESTION 7:Does a multidisciplinary team, consisting of neurosurgery and neurotology, provides the best outcomes of complete resection and facial/vestibulocochlear nerve preservation for patients undergoing resection of VSs? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support stating that a multidisciplinary team, usually consisting of a neurosurgeon and a neurotologist, provides superior outcomes compared to either subspecialist working alone. QUESTION 8:Does a subtotal surgical resection of a VS followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the residual tumor provide comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support subtotal resection (STR) followed by SRS provides comparable hearing and FN preservation to patients who undergo a complete surgical resection. QUESTION 9:Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative balance problems more effectively than SRS? RECOMMENDATION:There is insufficient evidence to support either surgical resection or SRS for treatment of preoperative balance problems. QUESTION 10:Does surgical resection of VS treat preoperative trigeminal neuralgia more effectively than SRS? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: Surgical resection of VSs may be used to better relieve symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia than SRS. QUESTION 11:Is surgical resection of VSs more difficult (associated with higher facial neuropathies and STR rates) after initial treatment with SRS? RECOMMENDATION:Level 3: If microsurgical resection is necessary after SRS, it is recommended that patients be counseled that there is an increased likelihood of a STR and decreased FN function.

29524011,HIVprotI: an integrated web based platform for prediction and design of HIV proteins inhibitors.,"A number of anti-retroviral drugs are being used for treating Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. Due to emergence of drug resistant strains, there is a constant quest to discover more effective anti-HIV compounds. In this endeavor, computational tools have proven useful in accelerating drug discovery. Although methods were published to design a class of compounds against a specific HIV protein, but an integrated web server for the same is lacking. Therefore, we have developed support vector machine based regression models using experimentally validated data from ChEMBL repository. Quantitative structure activity relationship based features were selected for predicting inhibition activity of a compound against HIV proteins namely protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). The models presented a maximum Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78, 0.76, 0.74 and 0.76, 0.68, 0.72 during tenfold cross-validation on IC50 and percent inhibition datasets of PR, RT, IN respectively. These models performed equally well on the independent datasets. Chemical space mapping, applicability domain analyses and other statistical tests further support robustness of the predictive models. Currently, we have identified a number of chemical descriptors that are imperative in predicting the compound inhibition potential. HIVprotI platform ( http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/hivproti ) would be useful in virtual screening of inhibitors as well as designing of new molecules against the important HIV proteins for therapeutics development.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data not unique
29630775,PR-10 proteins as potential mediators of melatonin-cytokinin cross-talk in plants: crystallographic studies of LlPR-10.2B isoform from yellow lupine.,"LlPR-10.2B, a Pathogenesis-related class 10 (PR-10) protein from yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) was crystallized in complex with melatonin, an emerging important plant regulator and antioxidant. The structure reveals two molecules of melatonin bound in the internal cavity of the protein, plus a very well-defined electron density near the cavity entrance, corresponding to an unknown ligand molecule comprised of two flat rings, which is most likely a product of melatonin transformation. In a separate LlPR-10.2B co-crystallization experiment with an equimolar mixture of melatonin and trans-zeatin, which is a cytokinin phytohormone well recognized as a PR-10-binding partner, a quaternary 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 complex was formed, in which one of the melatonin-binding sites has been substituted with trans-zeatin, whereas the binding of melatonin at the second binding site and binding of the unknown ligand are undisturbed. This unusual complex, when compared with the previously described PR-10/trans-zeatin complexes and with the emerging structural information about melatonin binding by PR-10 proteins, provides intriguing insights into the role of PR-10 proteins in phytohormone regulation in plants, especially with the involvement of melatonin, and implicates the PR-10 proteins as low-affinity melatonin binders under the conditions of elevated melatonin concentration.

We also analyzed correlated genes of CD177 by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis to predict the potential relationship between neutrophils and prognosis of PDAC. We then performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens to verify infiltration of neutrophils in PDAC tissues. After analyzing mRNA expression data and clinical follow-up survey provided in the GEO dataset (GSE21501, containing samples from 102 PDAC patients) and clinicopathological data of 23 PDAC patients, we demonstrated that CD177 was correlated with poor prognosis. The univariate Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that OS was inversely associated with increased expression of CD177 (P�=�0.012). Expression of phosphodiesterase (PDE)4D was positively related to CD177 in gene correlation analysis (R�=�0.413, P�<�0.001) by R2 platform. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry of CD177 in 23 PDAC surgical samples showed accumulation of neutrophils in the stroma and blood vessels around the cancer cells. In addition, immunohistochemical staining showed that CD177 was highly expressed in the stroma and blood vessels around tumor tissues of PDAC, which was similar to H&E staining. Expression of CD177 can be used to represent infiltration of neutrophils, which may have potential prognostic value in PDAC.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
29983907,Rapid onset of action and reduced nasal hyperreactivity: new targets in allergic rhinitis management.,"<h4>Background</h4>This article summarizes a EUFOREA symposium, presented during the European Rhinology Research Forum in Brussels (9-10 November 2017; https://www.rhinologyresearch.eu/) which focused on novel pathways and therapeutic approaches in allergic rhinitis (AR).<h4>Main body</h4>AR remains under-diagnosed, under-estimated and under-treated. A key component in understanding the AR landscape has been the realization of a significant mismatch between how physicians instruct AR patients to manage their disease and what AR patients actually do in real life. Data from the <i>Allergy Diary</i> (developed by MACVIA ARIA) showed that AR patients take their medication prn, rapidly switch treatments, often experience poor control, use multiple therapies and stop treatment when symptoms are controlled. Better control of AR may be achievable by using an AR treatment which has a rapid onset of action and which effectively targets breakthrough symptoms. Indeed, AR patients report complete symptom relief, lack of breakthrough symptoms, rapid onset of action, safety and use on an 'as needed' basis as key targets for new nasal sprays. MP-AzeFlu comprises intranasal azelastine and fluticasone propionate (FP) in a novel formulation delivered in a single device. It is the first AR treatment to break the 5�min onset of action threshold and provides clinically relevant symptom relief in 15�min, much faster than that noted for FP + oral loratadine. MP-AzeFlu also significantly reduces nasal hyperresponsiveness (NHR) which may be responsible for the breakthrough symptoms frequently reported by AR patients. Mechanisms underlying MP-AzeFlu's effect include inhibition of mast cell degranulation, stabilization of the mucosal barrier, synergistic inhibition of inflammatory cell recruitment and a unique desensitization of sensory neurons expressing the transient receptor potential A1 and V1 channels.<h4>Conclusion</h4>With the most rapid onset of action and onset of clinically-relevant effect of any AR medication currently available, and proven efficacy in the treatment of NHR, MP-AzeFlu is an AR treatment which provides what patients want, and fits how patients manage their AR in real life.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30026590,Adult energy requirements predicted from doubly labeled water.,"<h4>Background</h4>Estimating energy requirements forms an integral part of developing diet and activity interventions. Current estimates often rely on a product of physical activity level (PAL) and a resting metabolic rate (RMR) prediction. PAL estimates, however, typically depend on subjective self-reported activity or a clinician's best guess. Energy-requirement models that do not depend on an input of PAL may provide an attractive alternative.<h4>Methods</h4>Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) measured by doubly labeled water (DLW) and a metabolic chamber from 119 subjects obtained from a database of pre-intervention measurements measured at Pennington Biomedical Research Center were used to develop a metabolic ward and free-living models that predict energy requirements. Graded models, including different combinations of input variables consisting of age, height, weight, waist circumference, body composition, and the resting metabolic rate were developed. The newly developed models were validated and compared to three independent databases.<h4>Results</h4>Sixty-four different linear and nonlinear regression models were developed. The adjusted R<sup>2</sup> for models predicting free-living energy requirements ranged from 0.65 with covariates of age, height, and weight to 0.74 in models that included body composition and RMR. Independent validation R<sup>2</sup> between actual and predicted TEE varied greatly across studies and between genders with higher coefficients of determination, lower bias, slopes closer to 1, and intercepts closer to zero, associated with inclusion of body composition and RMR covariates. The models were programmed into a user-friendly web-based app available at: http://www.pbrc.edu/research-and-faculty/calculators/energy-requirements/ (Video Demo for Reviewers at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UKjJeQdODQ ) CONCLUSIONS: Energy-requirement equations that do not require knowledge of activity levels and include all available input variables can provide more accurate baseline estimates. The models are clinically accessible through the web-based application.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

30387741,A Note on GRegNetSim: A Tool for the Discrete Simulation and Analysis of Genetic Regulatory Networks.,"Discrete simulations of genetic regulatory networks were used to study subsystems of yeast successfully. However, implementations of existing models underlying these simulations do not support a graphic interface, and require computations necessary to analyze their results to be done manually. Furthermore, differences between existing models suggest that an enriched model, encompassing both existing models, is needed. We developed a software tool, GRegNetSim, that allows the end-user to describe genetic regulatory networks graphically. The user can specify various transition functions at different nodes of the network, supporting, for example, threshold and gradient effects, and then apply the network to a variety of inputs. GRegNetSim displays the relationship between the inputs and the mode of behavior of the network in a graphic form that is easy to interpret. Furthermore, it can automatically extract statistical data necessary to analyze the simulations. The discrete simulations performed by GRegNetSim can be used to elucidate and predict the behavior, structure and properties of genetic regulatory networks in a unified manner. GRegNetSim is implemented as a Cytoscape App. Installation files, examples and source code, along with a detailed user guide, are freely available at https://sites.google.com/site/gregnetsim/.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30572878,"Geographical mobility of UK trainee doctors, from family home to first job: a national cohort study.","<h4>Background</h4>The UK faces geographical variation in the recruitment of doctors. Understanding where medical graduates choose to go for training is important because doctors are more likely to consider practicing in areas where they completed postgraduate training. The wider literature also suggests that there is a relationship between origin and background, and where doctors wish to train/work. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the geographical mobility of UK medical graduates from different socio-economic groups in terms of where they wish to spend their first years of postgraduate training.<h4>Methods</h4>This was an observational study of Foundation Programme (FP) doctors who graduated from 33 UK medical schools between 2012 and 2014. Data was accessed via the UK medical education database (UKMED: https://www.ukmed.ac.uk/ ). Chi-square tests were used to examine the relationships between doctor's sociodemographic characteristics and the dependent variable, average driving time from parental home to foundation school/region. Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) were used to estimate the effects of those factors in combination against the outcome measure.<h4>Results</h4>The majority of doctors prefer to train at foundation schools that are reasonably close to the family home. Those who attended state-funded schools, from non-white ethnic groups and/or from lower socio-economic groups were significantly more likely to choose foundation schools nearer their parental home. Doctors from disadvantaged backgrounds (as determined by entitlement to free school meals, OR = 1.29, p�= 0.003 and no parental degree, OR = 1.34, p�< 0.001) were associated with higher odds of selecting a foundation schools that were closer to parental home.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The data suggests that recruiting medical students from lower socioeconomic groups and those who originate from under-recruiting areas may be at least part of the solution to filling training posts in these areas. This has obvious implications for the widening access agenda, and equitable distribution of health services.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
30867992,Lightweight data management with dtool.,"The explosion in volumes and types of data has led to substantial challenges in data management. These challenges are often faced by front-line researchers who are already dealing with rapidly changing technologies and have limited time to devote to data management. There are good high-level guidelines for managing and processing scientific data. However, there is a lack of simple, practical tools to implement these guidelines. This is particularly problematic in a highly distributed research environment where needs differ substantially from group to group and centralised solutions are difficult to implement and storage technologies change rapidly. To meet these challenges we have developed dtool, a command line tool for managing data. The tool packages data and metadata into a unified whole, which we call a dataset. The dataset provides consistency checking and the ability to access metadata for both the whole dataset and individual files. The tool can store these datasets on several different storage systems, including a traditional file system, object store (S3 and Azure) and iRODS. It includes an application programming interface that can be used to incorporate it into existing pipelines and workflows. The tool has provided substantial process, cost, and peace-of-mind benefits to our data management practices and we want to share these benefits. The tool is open source and available freely online at http://dtool.readthedocs.io.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31093959,Sex differences in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis: An obstacle to antidepressant drug development?,"Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction has long been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, and HPA axis-based compounds have served as potential new therapeutic targets, but with no success. This review details sex differences from animal and human studies in the function of HPA axis elements (glucocorticoids, corticotropin releasing factor, and vasopressin) and related compounds tested as candidate antidepressants. We propose that sex differences contribute to the failure of novel HPA axis-based drugs in clinical trials. Compounds studied preclinically in males were tested in clinical trials that recruited more, if not exclusively, women, and did not control, but rather adjusted, for potential sex differences. Indeed, clinical trials of antidepressants are usually not stratified by sex or other important factors, although preclinical and epidemiological data support such stratification. In conclusion, we suggest that clinical testing of HPA axis-related compounds creates an opportunity for targeted, personalized antidepressant treatments based on sex.

31150060,Augmented Interval List: a novel data structure for efficient genomic interval search.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Genomic data is frequently stored as segments or intervals. Because this data type is so common, interval-based comparisons are fundamental to genomic analysis. As the volume of available genomic data grows, developing efficient and scalable methods for searching interval data is necessary.<h4>Results</h4>We present a new data structure, the Augmented Interval List (AIList), to enumerate intersections between a query interval q and an interval set R. An AIList is constructed by first sorting R as a list by the interval start coordinate, then decomposing it into a few approximately flattened components (sublists), and then augmenting each sublist with the running maximum interval end. The query time for AIList is O(log2N+n+m), where n is the number of overlaps between R and q, N is the number of intervals in the set R and m is the average number of extra comparisons required to find the n overlaps. Tested on real genomic interval datasets, AIList code runs 5-18 times faster than standard high-performance code based on augmented interval-trees, nested containment lists or R-trees (BEDTools). For large datasets, the memory-usage for AIList is 4-60% of other methods. The AIList data structure, therefore, provides a significantly improved fundamental operation for highly scalable genomic data analysis.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>An implementation of the AIList data structure with both construction and search algorithms is available at http://ailist.databio.org.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31173064,RAISS: robust and accurate imputation from summary statistics.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Multi-trait analyses using public summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are becoming increasingly popular. A constraint of multi-trait methods is that they require complete summary data for all traits. Although methods for the imputation of summary statistics exist, they lack precision for genetic variants with small effect size. This is benign for univariate analyses where only variants with large effect size are selected a posteriori. However, it can lead to strong p-value inflation in multi-trait testing. Here we present a new approach that improve the existing imputation methods and reach a precision suitable for multi-trait analyses.<h4>Results</h4>We fine-tuned parameters to obtain a very high accuracy imputation from summary statistics. We demonstrate this accuracy for variants of all effect sizes on real data of 28 GWAS. We implemented the resulting methodology in a python package specially designed to efficiently impute multiple GWAS in parallel.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The python package is available at: https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/statistical-genetics/raiss, its accompanying documentation is accessible here http://statistical-genetics.pages.pasteur.fr/raiss/.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
31179198,An Emergent Space for Distributed Data with Hidden Internal Order through Manifold Learning.,"Manifold-learning techniques are routinely used in mining complex spatiotemporal data to extract useful, parsimonious data representations/parametrizations; these are, in turn, useful in nonlinear model identification tasks. We focus here on the case of time series data that can ultimately be modelled as a spatially distributed system (e.g. a partial differential equation, PDE), but where we do not know the space in which this PDE should be formulated. Hence, even the spatial coordinates for the distributed system themselves need to be identified - to """"emerge from""""-the data mining process. We will first validate this """"emergent space"""" reconstruction for time series sampled <i>without space labels</i> in known PDEs; this brings up the issue of observability of physical space from temporal observation data, and the transition from spatially resolved to lumped (order-parameter-based) representations by tuning the scale of the data mining kernels. We will then present actual emergent space """"discovery"""" illustrations. Our illustrative examples include chimera states (states of coexisting coherent and incoherent dynamics), and chaotic as well as quasiperiodic spatiotemporal dynamics, arising in partial differential equations and/or in heterogeneous networks. We also discuss how data-driven """"spatial"""" coordinates can be extracted in ways invariant to the nature of the measuring instrument. Such gauge-invariant data mining can go beyond the fusion of heterogeneous observations of the same system, to the possible matching of apparently different systems.

31296218,Evaluating single-subject study methods for personal transcriptomic interpretations to advance precision medicine.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gene expression profiling has benefited medicine by providing clinically relevant insights at the molecular candidate and systems levels. However, to adopt a more 'precision' approach that integrates individual variability including 'omics data into risk assessments, diagnoses, and therapeutic decision making, whole transcriptome expression needs to be interpreted meaningfully for single subjects. We propose an """"all-against-one"""" framework that uses biological replicates in isogenic conditions for testing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in a single subject (ss) in the absence of an appropriate external reference standard or replicates. To evaluate our proposed """"all-against-one"""" framework, we construct reference standards (RSs) with five conventional replicate-anchored analyses (NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, DESeq, DESeq2) and the remainder were treated separately as single-subject sample pairs for ss analyses (without replicates).<h4>Results</h4>Eight ss methods (NOISeq, DEGseq, edgeR, mixture model, DESeq, DESeq2, iDEG, and ensemble) for identifying genes with differential expression were compared in Yeast (parental line versus snf2 deletion mutant; n�= 42/condition) and a MCF7 breast-cancer cell line (baseline versus stimulated with estradiol; n�= 7/condition). Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall plots were determined for eight ss methods against each of the five RSs in both datasets. Consistent with prior analyses of these data, ~ 50% and ~ 15% DEGs were obtained in Yeast and MCF7 datasets respectively, regardless of the RSs method. NOISeq, edgeR, and DESeq were the most concordant for creating a RS. Single-subject versions of NOISeq, DEGseq, and an ensemble learner achieved the best median ROC-area-under-the-curve to compare two transcriptomes without replicates regardless of the RS method and dataset (> 90% in Yeast, > 0.75 in MCF7). Further, distinct specific single-subject methods perform better according to different proportions of DEGs.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The """"all-against-one"""" framework provides a honest evaluation framework for single-subject DEG studies since these methods are evaluated, by design, against reference standards produced by unrelated DEG methods. The ss-ensemble method was the only one to reliably produce higher accuracies in all conditions tested in this conservative evaluation framework. However, single-subject methods for identifying DEGs from paired samples need improvement, as no method performed with precision> 90% and obtained moderate levels of recall. http://www.lussiergroup.org/publications/EnsembleBiomarker.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

31618061,Lexical-Level Predictors of Reading Comprehension in Third Grade: Is Spelling a Unique Contributor?,"Purpose Considerable research effort has focused on understanding reading comprehension and reading comprehension difficulties. The purpose of this correlational study was to add to the small but growing body of literature on the role that spelling may play in reading comprehension, by investigating the full range of lexical-level literacy skills and whether spelling makes a unique contribution. This study also explored whether these relations vary with the spelling scoring metric. Method Data were collected from 63 children attending Grade 3 in a Midwestern state. In addition to measuring reading comprehension, word recognition, and vocabulary, 4 spelling scoring metrics were examined: the number of words spelled correctly, the number of correct letter sequences (CLS), and Spelling Sensitivity Scores for elements and for words. Results All spelling metrics were significantly correlated with reading comprehension. Results of hierarchical regressions showed that spelling was a significant, unique predictor of reading comprehension when the CLS metric was used. The scoring metrics were differentially related to reading comprehension. Metrics that gave credit based on orthographic precision only (number of words spelled correctly and CLS) were more highly related to reading comprehension than metrics that scored not only on orthographic accuracy but also on phonological and morphological accuracy (Spelling Sensitivity Scores for elements and for words). Conclusion These results indicate that spelling is related to reading comprehension and have theoretical and clinical implications for the use of spelling assessment.

31656094,"Genetic Susceptibility, Dietary Protein Intake, and Changes of Blood Pressure: The POUNDS Lost Trial.","High blood pressure (BP) is closely related to obesity, and weight loss lowers BP. Evidence has shown considerable interpersonal variation of changes in BP among people experiencing weight loss, and such variation might be partly determined by genetic factors. We assessed the changes in systolic and diastolic BP (SBP/DBP) among 692 participants randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets varying in macronutrient content for 2 years. Two separate polygenic scores (SBP/DBP-PGS derived from 52/50 single nucleotide polymorphisms) were built for each participant based on 66 BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a 2-year intervention, participants in the bottom versus upper tertile of SBP/DBP-PGS had a greater decrease in SBP (<U+25B3>SBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.84 versus -1.61, -4.76 versus -2.75, -2.49 versus -1.63; <i>P</i>=0.001) or in DBP (<U+25B3>DBP at 6, 12, and 24 months: -3.09 versus -1.34, -2.69 versus -1.44, -1.82 versus -0.53; <i>P</i><0.001). We also found gene-diet interaction on changes in SBP from baseline to 24 months (<i>P</i><sub>interaction</sub>=0.009). Among participants assigned to a high-protein diet, those with a lower SBP-polygenic scores had greater decreases in SBP at months 6 (<i>P</i>=0.018), months 12 (<i>P</i>=0.007), and months 24 (<i>P</i>=0.089); while no significant difference was observed across the SBP-polygenic scores tertile groups among those assigned to an average-protein diet (all <i>P</i> values >0.05).

31730280,Temperature dependence of NMR chemical shifts: Tracking and statistical analysis.,"Isotropic chemical shifts measured by solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy offer extensive insights into protein structure and dynamics. Temperature dependences add a valuable dimension; notably, the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts are valuable probes of hydrogen bonding, temperature-dependent loss of structure, and exchange between distinct protein conformations. Accordingly, their uses include structural analysis of both folded and disordered proteins, and determination of the effects of mutations, binding, or solution conditions on protein energetics. Fundamentally, these temperature dependences result from changes in the local magnetic environments of nuclei, but correlations with global thermodynamic parameters measured via calorimetric methods have been observed. Although the temperature dependences of amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts are often well approximated by a linear model, deviations from linearity are also observed and may be interpreted as evidence of fast exchange between distinct conformational states. Here, we describe computational methods, accessible via the Shift-T web server, including an automated tracking algorithm that propagates initial (single temperature) <sup>1</sup> H<U+F8FF><sup>15</sup> N cross peak assignments to spectra collected over a range of temperatures. Amide proton and nitrogen temperature coefficients (slopes determined by fitting chemical shift vs. temperature data to a linear model) are subsequently calculated. Also included are methods for the detection of systematic, statistically significant deviation from linearity (curvature) in the temperature dependences of amide proton chemical shifts. The use and utility of these methods are illustrated by example, and the Shift-T web server is freely available at http://meieringlab.uwaterloo.ca/shiftt.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

Useful and intuitive visualization tools may help advance biomolecular and medical research; unintuitive tools may bar important breakthroughs. This protocol describes two use cases for the CellMap (http://cellmap.protein.properties) web tool. The tool allows researchers to visualize human protein-protein interaction data constrained by protein subcellular localizations. In the simplest form, proteins are visualized on cell images that also show protein-protein interactions (PPIs) through lines (edges) connecting the proteins across the compartments. At a glance, this simultaneously highlights spatial constraints that proteins are subject to in their physical environment and visualizes PPIs against these localizations. Visualizing two realities helps in decluttering the protein interaction visualization from """"hairball"""" phenomena that arise when single proteins or groups thereof interact with hundreds of partners. � 2019 The Authors.

32419835,Integrated Analysis of the Mechanisms of Da-Chai-Hu Decoction in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by a Network Pharmacology Approach.,"Background:The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has increased year by year, which not only seriously affects people's quality of life, but also imposes a heavy economic burden on the family, society, and country. Currently, the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of T2DM are still unclear. Therefore, exploration of a precise multitarget treatment strategy is urgent. Here, we attempt to screen out the active components, effective targets, and functional pathways of therapeutic drugs through network pharmacology with taking advantages of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulas for multitarget holistic treatment of diseases to clarify the potential therapeutic mechanism of TCM formulas and provide a systematic and clear thought for T2DM treatment. Methods:First, we screened the active components of Da-Chai-Hu Decoction (DCHD) by absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/T) calculation. Second, we predicted and screened the active components of DCHD and its therapeutic targets for T2DM relying on the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Analysis Platform (TCMSP database) and Text Mining Tool (GoPubMed database), while using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to obtain T2DM targets. Third, we constructed a network of the active component-target, target-pathway of DCHD using Cytoscape software (http://cytoscape.org/,ver.3.5.1) and then analyzed gene function, related biological processes, and signal pathways through the DAVID database. Results:We screened 77 active components from 1278 DCHD components and 116 effective targets from 253 ones. After matching the targets of T2DM, we obtained 38 important targets and 7 core targets were selected through further analysis. Through enrichment analysis, we found that these important targets were mainly involved in many biological processes such as oxidative stress, inflammatory reaction, and apoptosis. After analyzing the relevant pathways, the synthetic pathway for the treatment of T2DM was obtained, which provided a diagnosis-treatment idea for DCHD in the treatment of T2DM. Conclusions:This article reveals the mechanism of DCHD in the treatment of T2DM related to inflammatory response and apoptosis through network pharmacology, which lays a foundation for further elucidation of drugs effective targets.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,

In this study, we aimed to identify key proteins involved in the pathogenesis of COPD.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>We collected lung tissue from three patients with COPD who required thoracic surgery for lung transplantation in the China-Japan Friendship Hospital. Lung tissue from three donors who had no history of lung disease <U+FEFF>was collected as healthy controls through a whole-body donation program of Peking Union Medical College (China). We conducted a proteomic analysis of the protein expression profiles in the two groups using a combination of high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantitative 6-plex tandem mass tag-labeling; these data were validated by Western blot analysis.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 4976 proteins were identi<U+FB01>ed and analyzed, of which 173 were significantly changed (118 downregulated and 55 upregulated). Gene ontology analysis and protein-protein interaction networks demonstrated that the significantly changed proteins, especially downregulated proteins, were involved in platelet and macrophage activation. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org) via the iProX partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD017158.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In our study, GP6, PF4, and THBS1, which are associated with platelet activation and wound healing, were significantly downregulated in COPD patients. These results indicate that patients with COPD are more likely to develop hemostasis disorders, which could impede the repair process of the lung tissues. Moreover, downregulation of CD163, MARCO and VSIG4, which are involved in dysfunction of alveolar macrophages in efferocytosis, may inhibit the resolution of inflammation and contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,data deposited as referenced

Allergic reactions to partly foreign biologics can occur due to their potential immunogenicity. The severity of an immune response to a biological drug may range from no clinical significance to a severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reaction.<b>Methods:</b> Detailed searches were performed on Pubmed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to include all available publications. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and British Columbia Cancer Agency Drug Manual databases were screened for hypersensitivity reaction (HSR), infusion reaction, injection site reaction, urticaria, and anaphylaxis for individual BSs.<b>Results:</b> Treatment with BSs can cause various types of HSR. These are mentioned in the literature with definitions such as allergic reactions, anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis, HSR, infusion reactions, injection site reactions, cytokine release syndrome, and urticaria. Due to the overlap in signs and symptoms in the reported descriptions, it is not always possible to differentiate these reactions properly according to their pathomechanism. Similarly, many data reported as anaphylaxis actually describe severe anaphylactic reactions (grades III or IV).<b>Conclusion:</b> There is an urgent need for a simpler symptom- or system-based classification and scoring system to create an awareness for HSRs to BSs. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of HSRs and increased clinical experience in the treatment of side effects will provide timely control of unexpected reactions. As a result, immunotherapy with BSs will become safer in the future.<b>Cite this as G�lsen A</b>, <b>Wedi B</b>, <b>Jappe U.

In adult mammals, optic nerve injuries and progressive degenerative diseases lead to the irreversible loss of RGCs, resulting in vision loss and blindness. Optogenetic models have proved useful in manipulating the growth of RGCs through expression and stimulation of channelrhodopsins (Chr2) in RGCs using the RGC-specific thy-1 promoter. Using transgenic Chr2 mouse (Thy1-ChR2-EYFP) as a model of regeneration, we profile the lipid changes which occur after traumatic optic nerve crush, light stimulation and forced RGC axonal growth. Thy1-ChR2-EYFP and control (C57BL/6) mice were divided in four groups each - 1) no crush and no stimulation, 2) no crush with stimulation, 3) crush and without stimulation, and 4) crush with stimulation.

However, the induced long-term neuroplasticity modulation still needs to be further characterized. This study investigated the functional reorganization and its structural base after BCI-guided robot-assisted training using resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The clinical improvement and the neurological changes before, immediately after, and six months after 20-session BCI-guided robot hand training were explored in 14 chronic stroke subjects. The structural base of the induced functional reorganization and motor improvement were also investigated using DTI. Repeated measure ANOVA indicated long-term motor improvement was found (F[2, 26] = 6.367, p = 0.006). Significantly modulated functional connectivity (FC) was observed between ipsilesional motor regions (M1 and SMA) and some contralesional areas (SMA, PMd, SPL) in the seed-based analysis. Modulated FC with ipsilesional M1 was significantly correlated with motor function improvement (r = 0.6455, p = 0.0276). Besides, increased interhemispheric FC among the sensorimotor area from resting-state data and increased laterality index from task-based data together indicated the re-balance of the two hemispheres during the recovery. Multiple linear regression models suggested that both motor function improvement and the functional change between ipsilesional M1 and contralesional premotor area were significantly associated with the ipsilesional corticospinal tract integrity. The results in the current study provided solid support for stroke recovery mechanism in terms of interhemispheric interaction and its structural substrates, which could further enhance the understanding of BCI training in stroke rehabilitation.

33048108,A comprehensive comparison of residue-level methylation levels with the regression-based gene-level methylation estimations by ReGear.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>DNA methylation is a biological process impacting the gene functions without changing the underlying DNA sequence. The DNA methylation machinery usually attaches methyl groups to some specific cytosine residues, which modify the chromatin architectures. Such modifications in the promoter regions will inactivate some tumor-suppressor genes. DNA methylation within the coding region may significantly reduce the transcription elongation efficiency. The gene function may be tuned through some cytosines are methylated.<h4>Methods</h4>This study hypothesizes that the overall methylation level across a gene may have a better association with the sample labels like diseases than the methylations of individual cytosines. The gene methylation level is formulated as a regression model using the methylation levels of all the cytosines within this gene. A comprehensive evaluation of various feature selection algorithms and classification algorithms is carried out between the gene-level and residue-level methylation levels.<h4>Results</h4>A comprehensive evaluation was conducted to compare the gene and cytosine methylation levels for their associations with the sample labels and classification performances. The unsupervised clustering was also improved using the gene methylation levels. Some genes demonstrated statistically significant associations with the class label, even when no residue-level methylation features have statistically significant associations with the class label. So in summary, the trained gene methylation levels improved various methylome-based machine learning models. Both methodology development of regression algorithms and experimental validation of the gene-level methylation biomarkers are worth of further investigations in the future studies.

33201237,AlgPred 2.0: an improved method for predicting allergenic proteins and mapping of IgE epitopes.,"AlgPred 2.0 is a web server developed for predicting allergenic proteins and allergenic regions in a protein. It is an updated version of AlgPred developed in 2006. The dataset used for training, testing and validation consists of 10�075 allergens and 10�075 non-allergens. In addition, 10�451 experimentally validated immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitopes were used to identify antigenic regions in a protein. All models were trained on 80% of data called training dataset, and the performance of models was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation technique. The performance of the final model trained on the training dataset was evaluated on 20% of data called validation dataset; no two proteins in any two sets have more than 40% similarity. First, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search has been performed against the dataset, and allergens were predicted based on the level of similarity with known allergens. Second, IgE epitopes obtained from the IEDB database were searched in the dataset to predict allergens based on their presence in a protein. Third, motif-based approaches like multiple EM for motif elicitation/motif alignment and search tool have been used to predict allergens. Fourth, allergen prediction models have been developed using a wide range of machine learning techniques. Finally, the ensemble approach has been used for predicting allergenic protein by combining prediction scores of different approaches. Our best model achieved maximum performance in terms of area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.98 with Matthew's correlation coefficient 0.85 on the validation dataset. A web server AlgPred 2.0 has been developed that allows the prediction of allergens, mapping of IgE epitope, motif search and BLAST search (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/algpred2/).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,"tool only , I think"
33523611,Developing an evidence-based online method of linking behaviour change techniques and theoretical mechanisms of action: a multiple methods study,"<h4>Background</h4>Many global health challenges may be targeted by changing people�s behaviour. Behaviours including cigarette smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol misuse, as well as certain dietary behaviours, contribute to deaths and disability by increasing the risk of cancers, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Interventions have been designed to change these health behaviours with a view to reducing these health risks. However, the effectiveness of these interventions has been quite variable and further information is needed to enhance their success. More information is needed about the specific processes that underlie the effectiveness of intervention strategies.<h4>Aim</h4>Researchers have developed a taxonomy of 93 behaviour change techniques (i.e. the active components of an intervention that bring about behavioural change), but little is known regarding their potential mechanisms of action (i.e. the processes through which a behaviour change technique affects behaviour). We therefore aimed to examine links between behaviour change techniques and mechanisms of action.<h4>Method</h4>First, we conducted a literature synthesis study of 277 behaviour change intervention studies, from which we extracted information on links, described by authors, between behaviour change techniques and mechanisms of action, and identified an average of 10 links per intervention report. Second, behaviour change experts (n = 105) were engaged in a three-round consensus study in which they discussed and rated their confidence in the presence/absence of �links� and �non-links� between commonly used behaviour change techniques (n = 61) and a set of mechanisms of action (n = 26). Ninety links and 460 �non-links� reached the pre-set threshold of 80% agreement. To enhance the validity of these results, a third study was conducted that triangulated the findings of the first two studies. Discrepancies and uncertainties between the studies were included in a reconciliation consensus study with a new group of experts (n = 25). The final results identified 92 definite behaviour change technique�mechanism of action links and 465 definite non-links. In a fourth study, we examined whether or not groups of behaviour change techniques used together frequently across interventions revealed shared theoretical underpinnings. We found that experts agreed on the underlying theory for three groups of behaviour change techniques.<h4>Results</h4>Our results are potentially useful to policy-makers and practitioners in selecting behaviour change techniques to include in behaviour change interventions. However, our data do not demonstrate that the behaviour change techniques are effective in targeting the mechanism of action; rather, the links identified may be the �best bets� for interventions that are effective in changing mechanisms of action, and the non-links are unlikely to be effective. Researchers examining effectiveness of interventions in either primary studies or evidence syntheses may consider these links for further investigation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>To make our results usable by researchers, practitioners and policy-makers, they are available in an online interactive tool, which enables discussion and collaboration (https://theoryandtechniquetool.humanbehaviourchange.org/); accessed 1 March 2020. This work, building on previous work to develop the behaviour change technique taxonomy, is part of an ongoing programme of work: the Human Behaviour Change Project (www.humanbehaviourchange.org/; accessed 1 March 2020).<h4>Funding</h4>This project was funded by the Medical Research Council via its Methodology Panel: �Developing methodology for designing and evaluating theory-based complex interventions: an ontology for linking behaviour change techniques to theory� (reference MR/L011115/1).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,iffy

33902704,The impact of sequencing depth on the inferred taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of metagenomic samples.,"<h4>Background</h4>Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. There are many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. In this study we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the same samples to address these issues. We sampled three potential environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth (~ 200 million reads per sample). Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing (short- and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to the metagenomic data. To automate data processing, we developed an open-source software pipeline, 'ResPipe'.<h4>Results</h4>Taxonomic profiling was much more stable to sequencing depth than AMR gene content. 1 million reads per sample was sufficient to achieve < 1% dissimilarity to the full taxonomic composition. However, at least 80 million reads per sample were required to recover the full richness of different AMR gene families present in the sample, and additional allelic diversity of AMR genes was still being discovered in effluent at 200 million reads per sample. Normalising the number of reads mapping to AMR genes using gene length and an exogenous spike of Thermus thermophilus DNA substantially changed the estimated gene abundance distributions. While the majority of genomic content from cultured isolates from effluent was recoverable using shotgun metagenomics, this was not the case for pig caeca or river sediment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Sequencing depth and profiling method can critically affect the profiling of polymicrobial animal and environmental samples with shotgun metagenomics. Both sequencing of cultured isolates and shotgun metagenomics can recover substantial diversity that is not identified using the other methods. Particular consideration is required when inferring AMR gene content or presence by mapping metagenomic reads to a database. ResPipe, the open-source software pipeline we have developed, is freely available ( https://gitlab.com/hsgweon/ResPipe ).","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
33976872,Analysis of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> processing under salt stress in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> spore outgrowth using RNA sequencing data.,"<b>Background:</b> In spore-forming bacteria, the molecular mechanisms of accumulation of transfer RNA (tRNA) during sporulation must be a priority as tRNAs play an essential role in protein synthesis during spore germination and outgrowth. However, tRNA processing has not been extensively studied in these conditions, and knowledge of these mechanisms is important to understand long-term stress survival.��� <b>Methods:</b>To gain further insight into tRNA processing during spore germination and outgrowth, the expression of the single copy tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> gene was analyzed in the presence and absence of 1.2 M NaCl in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> using RNA-Seq data obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The CLC Genomics work bench 12.0.2 (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark, https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) was used to analyze reads from the tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> gene.� <b>Results:</b>The results show that spores store different populations of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup>-related molecules.� One such population, representing 60% of total tRNA <sup>Cys</sup>, was composed of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> fragments.� Half of these fragments (3�-tRF) possessed CC, CCA or incorrect additions at the 3�end. tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> with correct CCA addition at the 3�end represented 23% of total tRNA <sup>Cys</sup>, while with CC addition represented 9% of the total and with incorrect addition represented 7%. While an accumulation of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> precursors was induced by upregulation of the <i>rrnD</i> operon under the control of� s <sup>A</sup> -dependent promoters under both conditions investigated, salt stress produced only a modest effect on tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> expression and the accumulation of tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> related species. <b>Conclusions</b>:The results demonstrate that tRNA <sup>Cys</sup> molecules resident in spores undergo dynamic processing to produce functional molecules that may play an essential role during protein synthesis.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,references other data resource
34135895,Transcriptomic Signature Differences Between SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza Virus Infected Patients.,"The reason why most individuals with COVID-19 have relatively limited symptoms while other develop respiratory distress with life-threatening complications remains unknown. Increasing evidence suggests that COVID-19 associated adverse outcomes mainly rely on dysregulated immunity.�Here, we compared transcriptomic profiles of blood cells from 103 patients with different severity levels of COVID-19 with that of 27 healthy and 22 influenza-infected individuals. Data provided a complete overview of SARS-CoV-2-induced immune signature, including a dramatic defect in IFN responses, a reduction of toxicity-related molecules in NK cells, an increased degranulation of neutrophils, a dysregulation of T cells, a dramatic increase in B cell function and immunoglobulin production, as well as an important over-expression of genes involved in metabolism and cell cycle in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared to those infected with influenza viruses. These features also differed according to COVID-19 severity. Overall and specific gene expression patterns across groups can be visualized on an interactive website (https://bix.unil.ch/covid/). Collectively, these transcriptomic host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are discussed in the context of current studies, thereby improving our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and shaping the severity level of COVID-19.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,iffy - clinical but gene; seems to be viz only
34186186,"In silico modelling of acute toxicity of 1, 2, 4-triazole antifungal agents towards zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos: Application of the Small Dataset Modeller tool.","Nowadays, there is a widespread use of triazole antifungal agents to kill broad classes of fungi in farming lands and to protect herbs, fruits and grains. These agents further deposit into the aquatic systems causing toxicity to the living aquatic creatures, which can then affect human beings. Considering this issue, risk assessment of these toxic chemicals is a very essential task. Due to the inadequate experimental data on acute toxicity of antifungal agents containing the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring, higher testing costs along with the regulatory restrictions and the international regulations to lessen animal testing emphasize on in silico techniques such as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. The application of QSAR modelling has created an easier avenue to predict activity/property/toxicity of newly synthesized compounds. In the present study, we have used 23 antifungal agents containing the 1, 2, 4-triazole ring to develop 2D-QSAR models and explored their structural attributes crucial for acute toxicity towards embryonic phase of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Here, we have employed simple 2D descriptors to develop the QSAR models. The models were evolved by executing the Small Dataset Modeller tool (https://dtclab.webs.com/software-tools), and the validation of the models was achieved by employing different precise validation principles. The statistical validation metrics confirm that built models are robust, useful and well predictive to forecast the acute toxicity of new compounds.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
IND605743169,Estimating Thermodynamic Properties of Pure Triglyceride Systems Using the Triglyceride Property Calculator,"To date, the most comprehensive model for predicting thermodynamic properties of pure triglycerides was presented by Wesdorp in �<U+0080><U+009C>Liquid-multiple solid phase equilibria in fats: theory and experiments�<U+0080>� (1990). In this paper, we present (1) corrections to the published model, as well as (2) a software implementation of the model for numerical assessment. The software tool, Triglyceride Property Calculator (TPC), uses a semi-empirical model to estimate the enthalpy of fusion and melting temperature for a given triglyceride based on its molecular composition and polymorphic form. These estimates are compared to experimentally collected data when available. The web application is available at http://www.crcfoodandhealth.com (under research tools) and through the AOCS Lipid Library. The quality of estimates is characterized according to defined counting metrics and presented for TAG subcategories. Additionally, the extrapolative value of the TPC is assessed by checking for consistency with underlying thermodynamic constraints. The current TPC implementation is effective in describing experimentally collected melting point data, with greater than 91% of the fitted values falling within 10% of the actual data. The TPC is also very good at describing collected enthalpy data. The underlying semi-empirical model and parameter set perform well in ensuring enthalpy predictions are thermodynamically consistent, however, extrapolated melting temperatures appear unreliable. Developing models and parameter sets that ensure thermodynamic consistency is a priority with future TPC iterations.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
IND606427025,First Report of Sugarcane Yellow Leaf Disease in Mexico and Detection of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’-Related Strains in Affected Plants,"Sugarcane is a common name for any of several tall perennial grass species of the genus Saccharum. As a major source for sugar production and an efficient feedstock for biofuel generation, sugarcane is widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. Mexico alone produces over six million metric tons of cane sugar annually valued at 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. Although economically important, sugarcane is susceptible to devastating diseases caused by phloem-colonizing, cell wall-less bacteria known as phytoplasmas. Different sugarcane phytoplasmal diseases around the world have been attributed to diverse phytoplasmas belonging to six mutually distinct �Candidatus Phytoplasma� species (Marcone 2002). During the 2015 to 2016 growing season, sugarcane plants exhibiting leaf discolorations (white and yellow streaks) indicative of sugarcane yellow leaf (ScYL) disease were observed in a sugarcane field in Cosamaloapan, Veracruz, Mexico, with less than 1% of the plants in the field being affected. Leaf samples were collected from three symptomatic and three asymptomatic plants in the same field. Total DNA was extracted from leaf midribs using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method (Pe�rez-Lo�pez et al. 2016). A preliminary diagnostic assay was carried out using direct polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) with phytoplasma-specific primer pair R16F2n/R16R2. All PCR assays with DNA templates from symptomatic plants produced a phytoplasma-characteristic amplicon of 1.25 kb. No amplicon was detected from samples of asymptomatic plants. The DNA samples from symptomatic plants were subjected to further PCR analysis with primer pair P1A/16S-SR as previously described (Wei et al. 2011). All three samples were PCR positive, and each yielded a 1,539-bp amplicon. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced with at least 6� coverage per base position. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that the amplicon represented a near-full-length 16S rRNA gene and a partial 16S-23S RNA gene intergenic spacer. The obtained DNA sequences were deposited into GenBank (accession nos. MH891144 through MH891146). Analysis of the sequences through the iPhyClassifier (Zhao et al. 2009, https://plantpathology.ba.ars.usda.gov/cgi-bin/resource/iphyclassifier.cgi) revealed that the phytoplasmas detected in the ScYL-diseased plants were closely related to the reference strain of �Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris� (aster yellows phytoplasma, >99.4% sequence similarity). Although the three 16S rRNA gene sequences differed from each other by two to five bases, all possessed the entire set of signature sequences (G196GGAGGA202, C444TGACGGTACC454, and C976ACAGTGGA GGTTATCAGTTG996) of �Ca. P. asteris� (Lee et al. 2004), indicating the three ScYL phytoplasma strains are �sequevars� (Davis et al. 2015) affiliated with a single phytoplasma species. To our knowledge, this is the first report of phytoplasmal ScYL disease in Mexico. Associations of aster yellows phytoplasma with sugarcane diseases were previously reported in Cuba and Brazil (Arocha et al. 1999; Silva et al. 2009). Recently, infection of aster yellows phytoplasma in weedy grass growing near sugarcane fields in Mexico was noted (Pe�rez-Lo�pez and Dumonceaux 2017). Findings of aster yellows phytoplasma infecting sugarcane in the countries of Brazil, Cuba, and now Mexico (this report) underscore the need for disease surveillance of sugarcane in neighboring countries, because insect vectors capable of spreading aster yellows phytoplasma strains are known to be present over wide areas, including the Caribbean countries and the United States.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,
PMC3498971,"BioNetwork Bench: Database and Software for Storage, Query, and Analysis of Gene and Protein Networks","Gene and protein networks offer a powerful approach for integration of the disparate yet complimentary types of data that result from high-throughput analyses. Although many tools and databases are currently available for accessing such data, they are left unutilized by bench scientists as they generally lack features for effective analysis and integration of both public and private datasets and do not offer an intuitive interface for use by scientists with limited computational expertise. We describe BioNetwork Bench, an open source, user-friendly suite of database and software tools for constructing, querying, and analyzing gene and protein network models. It enables biologists to analyze public as well as private gene expression; interactively query gene expression datasets; integrate data from multiple networks; store and selectively share the data and results. Finally, we describe an application of BioNetwork Bench to the assembly and iterative expansion of a gene network that controls the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors. The tool is available from http://bionetworkbench.sourceforge.net/ Background The emergence of high-throughput technologies has allowed many biological investigators to collect a great deal of information about the behavior of genes and gene products over time or during a particular disease state. Gene and protein networks offer a powerful approach for integration of the disparate yet complimentary types of data that result from such high-throughput analyses. There are a growing number of public databases, as well as tools for visualization and analysis of networks. However, such databases and tools have yet to be widely utilized by bench scientists, as they generally lack features for effective analysis and integration of both public and private datasets and do not offer an intuitive interface for use by biological scientists with limited computational expertise. Results We describe BioNetwork Bench, an open source, user-friendly suite of database and software tools for constructing, querying, and analyzing gene and protein network models. BioNetwork Bench currently supports a broad class of gene and protein network models (eg, weighted and un-weighted, undirected graphs, multi-graphs). It enables biologists to analyze public as well as private gene expression, macromolecular interaction and annotation data; interactively query gene expression datasets; integrate data from multiple networks; query multiple networks for interactions of interest; store and selectively share the data as well as results of analyses. BioNetwork Bench is implemented as a plug-in for, and hence is fully interoperable with, Cytoscape, a popular open-source software suite for visualizing macromolecular interaction networks. Finally, we describe an application of BioNetwork Bench to the problem of assembly and iterative expansion of a gene network that controls the differentiation of retinal progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors. Conclusions BioNetwork Bench provides a suite of open source software for construction, querying, and selective sharing of gene and protein networks. Although initially aimed at a community of biologists interested in retinal development, the tool can be adapted easily to work with other biological systems simply by populating the associated database with the relevant datasets.","hji,kes",0,0,0,2,0.0,,no new data or value add?
